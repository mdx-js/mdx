Markdown for the\
**component era**
=================

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown
documents.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

## How does it work?

<div className="home-columns">
  <div className="home-column-start">
    You write markdown with embedded components through JSX:

    ```md
    import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
    export const year = 2018

    # Last yearâ€™s snowfall

    In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
    It was followed by a warm spring which caused
    flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

    <Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
    ```
  </div>

  <div className="home-column-end">
    Itâ€™s compiled to JavaScript you can use in any framework that supports JSX:

    {/* lint disable */}

    <div className="home-preview">
      # Last yearâ€™s snowfall

      In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
      It was followed by a warm spring which caused flood conditions in many of
      the nearby rivers.

      <Chart
        year={year}
        color="#fcb32c"
      />
    </div>

    {/* lint enable */}
  </div>
</div>
