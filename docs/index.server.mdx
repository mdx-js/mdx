MDX: Markdown for the\
**component era**
=================

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
🚀

***

## What does MDX do?

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    You write markdown with embedded components through JSX:

    ```mdx path="example.mdx"
    import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
    export const year = 2018

    # Last year’s snowfall

    In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
    It was followed by a warm spring which caused
    flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

    <Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    It gets compiled to JavaScript that you can use in any framework that supports JSX:

    {/* lint disable */}

    <div className="home-preview">
      # Last year’s snowfall

      In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
      It was followed by a warm spring which caused flood conditions in many of
      the nearby rivers.

      <Chart
        year={year}
        color="#fcb32c"
      />
    </div>

    {/* lint enable */}
  </div>
</div>

  ## New: MDX v2!

  Version 2 of MDX was released after years of hard work, and has many improvements.
  Here are the highlights:

  <div className="emoji-list">
    *   📝 **Improved syntax** makes it easier to use markdown in JSX in
        markdown
    *   🧑‍💻 **JavaScript expressions** turn `{2 * Math.PI}` into {2 * Math.PI}
    *   🔌 New **esbuild**, **Rollup**, and **Node.js** integrations
    *   ⚛️ **Any JSX runtime**: React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, you name it, they’re
        all supported
    *   🌳 **Improved AST** exposes more info in greater detail
    *   🏃‍♀️ Compiles at least **25% faster**
    *   🚴 Generated code runs twice as fast (**100% faster**)
    *   🚄 Bundle size of `@mdx-js/mdx` is more than three times as small
        (**250% smaller**)
    *   🧵 …and much, so much more

## MDX in short

<div className="emoji-list">
  *   ❤️ **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
      JSX-based projects
  *   💻 **Everything is a component**: Use existing components in your
      MDX and import other MDX files as components
  *   🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
      construct (`{h1: MyHeading}`)
  *   📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
      you use JSX only when you want to
  *   🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
      during the build stage
</div>
