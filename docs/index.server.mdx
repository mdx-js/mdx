Markdown for the\
**component era**
=================

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast. {/* more */}

  ## New: MDX 2!

  Version 2 of MDX was released after years of hard work, and has many
  improvements.
  Here are the highlights:

  <div className="emoji-list">
    *   📝 **Improved syntax** makes it easier to use markdown in JSX
    *   🧑‍💻 **JavaScript expressions** turn `{2 * Math.PI}` into {2 * Math.PI}
    *   🔌 New **esbuild**, **Rollup**, and **Node.js** integrations
    *   ⚛️ **Any JSX runtime**: React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, you name it, they’re
        all supported
    *   🌳 **Improved AST** exposes more info in greater detail
    *   🏃‍♀️ Compiles at least **25% faster**
    *   🚴 Generated code runs twice as fast (**100% faster**)
    *   🚄 Bundle size of `@mdx-js/mdx` is more than three times as small
        (**250% smaller**)
    *   🧵 …and much, so much more
  </div>

## What does MDX do?

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    You write markdown with embedded components through JSX:

    ```mdx path="example.mdx"
    import {Chart} from './snowfall.js'
    export const year = 2018

    # Last year’s snowfall

    In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
    It was followed by a warm spring which caused
    flood conditions in many of the nearby rivers.

    <Chart year={year} color="#fcb32c" />
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    It gets compiled to JavaScript that you can use in any framework that
    supports JSX:

    {/* lint disable */}

    <div className="home-preview">
      # Last year’s snowfall

      In {year}, the snowfall was above average.
      It was followed by a warm spring which caused flood conditions in many of
      the nearby rivers.

      <Chart
        year={year}
        color="#fcb32c"
      />
    </div>

    {/* lint enable */}
  </div>
</div>

We made an interactive playground where you can try MDX out and see what it
turns into.
[Play »][playground]

## Get started

There are integrations for most bundlers, frameworks, and editors.
Whether you build with Next.js, Docusaurus, or Gatsby.
You prefer esbuild, Rollup, or webpack.
You’re using React, Preact, or Vue.

## MDX in short

<div className="emoji-list">
  *   ❤️ **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
      JSX-based projects
  *   💻 **Everything is a component**: Use existing components in your
      MDX and import other MDX files as components
  *   🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
      construct (`{h1: MyHeading}`)
  *   📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
      you use JSX only when you want to
  *   🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
      during the build stage
</div>
