# Using MDX

This article explains how to use MDX files in your project.
See [§ Getting started][start] for how to integrate MDX into your project.
If you’re new to MDX we recommend that you start with [§ What is MDX][what].

## How MDX works

An integration compiles MDX syntax to JavaScript.
Say we have an MDX document, `example.mdx`:

```mdx
export const Thing = () => <>World</>

# Hello <Thing />
```

That’s *roughly* turned into the following JavaScript.
The below might help to form a mental model:

```js
/* @jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react */

export const Thing = () => <>World</>

export default function MDXContent() {
  return <h1>Hello <Thing /></h1>
}
```

Some observations:

*   The output is serialized JavaScript that still needs to be evaluated
*   A comment is injected to configure how JSX is handled
*   It’s a complete file with import/exports
*   A component (`MDXContent`) is exported

The *actual* output is:

```js
/* @jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react */
import {Fragment as _Fragment, jsx as _jsx, jsxs as _jsxs} from 'react/jsx-runtime'

export const Thing = () => _jsx(_Fragment, {children: 'World'})

function MDXContent(props = {}) {
  const _components = Object.assign({h1: 'h1'}, props.components)
  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = _components
  const _content = _jsx(_Fragment, {
    children: _jsxs(_components.h1, {
      children: ['Hello ', _jsx(Thing, {})]
    })
  })
  return MDXLayout
    ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {children: _content}))
    : _content
}

export default MDXContent
```

Some more observations:

*   JSX is compiled away to function calls and an import of React†
*   The content component can be given `{components: {h1: MyComponent}}` to use
    something else for the heading
*   The content component can be given `{components: {wrapper: MyLayout}}` to
    wrap the whole content

† MDX is not coupled to React.
You can also use it with [Preact][],
[Vue][], [Emotion][],
[Theme UI][],
etc.
Both the classic and automatic JSX runtimes are supported.

## MDX content

We just saw that MDX files are compiled to components.
You can use that component like any other component in your framework of choice.
Take for example this `example.mdx`:

```mdx
# Hi!
```

This file could be imported and used in a React app:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import Example from './example.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

ReactDom.render(<Example />, document.querySelector('#root'))
```

The main content is exported as the default export and all other values are also
exported.
Take this example:

```mdx
export const Thing = () => <>World</>

# Hello <Thing />
```

This could be imported like so:

```js
// A namespace import to get everything:
import * as everything from './example.mdx'
console.log(everything) // {Thing: [Function: Thing], default: [Function: MDXContent]}

// Default export shortcut and a named import specifier:
import Content, {Thing} from './example.mdx'
console.log(Content) // [Function: MDXContent]
console.log(Thing) // [Function: Thing]

// Import specifier with another local name:
import {Thing as AnotherName} from './example.mdx'
console.log(AnotherName) // [Function: Thing]
```

### Props

Components, regardless of framework, accept “props” (an object with arbitrary
data).
This object is available from within MDX content under the identifier `props`.
Take for example this `example.mdx`:

```mdx
# Hello {props.name}

The current year is {props.year}
```

This file could be used as:

```js
import Example from './example.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

// Use a `createElement` call:
React.createElement(Example, {name: 'Venus', year: 2021})

// Use JSX:
<Example name="Mars" year={2022} />
```

You don’t have to pass data.
You can also define (or import) it within MDX:

```jsx
export const year = 2019
export const fact = 'a particularly snowy year'

{year} has been {fact} when compared to the last decade.
```

### Components

There is one special prop: `components`.
It takes an object mapping component names to components.
Take this `example.mdx`:

```mdx
# Hello *<Planet />*
```

This file could be imported from JavaScript and passed components like so:

```js
import Example from './example.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

<Example components={{Planet: () => <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Pluto</span>}} />
```

You don’t have to pass components.
You can also define or import them within MDX:

```jsx
import {Box, Heading} from 'rebass'

MDX using imported components!

<Box>
  <Heading>Here’s a heading</Heading>
</Box>
```

Because MDX files *are* components, they can also import each other:

```jsx
import License from './license.md'
import Contributing from './docs/contributing.mdx'

# Hello world

<License />

---

<Contributing />
```

Here are some other examples of passing components:

```js
<Example
  components={{
    // Map `h1` (`# heading`) to use `h2`s.
    h1: 'h2',
    // Rewrite `em`s (`*like so*`) to `i` with a goldenrod foreground color.
    em: (props) => <i style={{color: 'goldenrod'}} {...props} />,
    // Pass a layout (using the special `'wrapper'` key).
    wrapper: ({components, ...rest}) => <main {...rest} />,
    // Pass a component.
    Planet: () => 'Neptune',
    // This nested component can be used as `<theme.text>hi</theme.text>`
    theme: {text: (props) => <span style={{color: 'grey'}} {...props} />}
  }}
/>
```

The following keys can be passed in `components`:

*   HTML equivalents for the things you write with markdown (such as `h1` for
    `# heading`)**†**
*   `wrapper`, which defines the layout (but a local layout takes precedence)
*   `*` anything else that is a valid JavaScript identifier (`foo`,
    `Quote`, `_`, `$x`, `a1`) for the things you write with JSX (like
    `<So />` or `<like.so />`, note that locally defined components take
    precedence)**‡**

**†** See the [§ Table of components][toc] for examples

**‡** The rules for whether a name in JSX (`x` in `<x>`) is a literal tag name
or not, are as follows:

*   If there’s a dot, it’s a member expression (`<a.b>` -> `h(a.b)`),
    which means that the `b` component is taken from object `a`
*   Otherwise, if the name is not a valid identifier, it’s a literal (`<a-b>` ->
    `h('a-b')`)
*   Otherwise, if it starts with a lowercase, it’s a literal (`<a>` -> `h('a')`)
*   Otherwise, it’s an identifier (`<A>` -> `h(A)`), which means a component `A`

### Layout

There is one special component: the layout.
If it is defined, it’s used to wrap the whole content.
A layout can be defined from within MDX using a default export:

```js
export default function Layout({children}) {
  return <main>{children}</main>;
}

All the things.
```

The layout can also be imported and *then* exported with an `export … from`:

```js
export {Layout as default} from './components.js'
```

The layout can also be passed as `components.wrapper` (but a local one takes
precedence).

## MDX provider

Passing components is typically fine.
Take for example this `post.mdx`:

```mdx
# Hello world
```

Used like so in `app.jsx`:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
import Post from './post.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.
import {Heading, /* … */ Table} from './components/index.js'

const components = {
  h1: Heading.H1,
  // …
  table: Table
}

ReactDom.render(
  <Post components={components} />,
  document.querySelector('#root')
)
```

But when you’re nesting MDX files (importing them into each other) it can become
cumbersome.
If `post.mdx` was instead importing and using other files:

```mdx
import License from './license.md'
import Contributing from './docs/contributing.mdx'

# Hello world

<License components={props.components} />

---

<Contributing components={props.components} />
```

To solve this, a *[context][]* can be used in React, Preact, and Vue.
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to
pass props down manually at every level.
Set it up like so:

1.  Install either [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react], [`@mdx-js/preact`][mdx-preact],
    or [`@mdx-js/vue`][mdx-vue],
    depending on what framework you’re using
2.  Configure your MDX integration with
    [`options.providerImportSource`][options-provider-import-source]
    set to that package, so either `'@mdx-js/react'`, `'@mdx-js/preact'`, or
    `'@mdx-js/vue'`
3.  Import `MDXProvider` from that package.
    Use it to wrap your top-most MDX content components and pass it your
    `components` instead:

```diff
 import React from 'react'
 import ReactDom from 'react-dom'
 import Post from './post.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.
 import {Heading, /* … */ Table} from './components/index.js'
+import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'

 const components = {
   h1: Heading.H1,
   // …
   table: Table
 }

 ReactDom.render(
-  <Post components={components} />,
+  <MDXProvider components={components}>
+    <Post />
+  </MDXProvider>,
   document.querySelector('#root')
 )
```

Now you can remove the explicit and verbose component passing:

```diff
 import License from './license.md'
 import Contributing from './docs/contributing.mdx'

 # Hello world

-<License components={props.components} />
+<License />

 ---

-<Contributing components={props.components} />
+<Contributing />
