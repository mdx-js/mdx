# Markdown in components

One great feature about MDX is that you can use Markdown within your JSX
components.

## Example

Lets say you wanted to create a custom `<Note />` component.
You could do something like this.

Using MDX 2:

```mdx
import Note from './Note'

# Hello from my MDX file.

Here is my `<Note />` component.

<Note>
  Markdown oh **yeah**!!
  [Cool, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
</Note>
```

The same example, using MDX 1 (notice the need blank lines between the tags and
the content):

```mdx
import Note from './Note'

# Hello from my MDX file.

Here is my `<Note />` component.

<Note>

Markdown oh **yeah**!!
[Cool, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

</Note>
```
