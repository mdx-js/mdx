# Writing a plugin

For a full-fledged introduction to plugins it’s recommended to read the
[remark guides][remark-guides] and study up on [syntax trees][syntax-trees].

Now let’s consider an example where you want to pass all headings through the
[title][] module to ensure consistent capitalization.
We can use [unist-util-visit][] to visit all headings and change the text nodes
with `title(text)`.

## Visiting heading nodes

The first thing you want to do is install the `unist-util-visit` library.
This is a utility library that allows you to visit all heading (or any other
type of nodes) without having to write a lot of boiler plate code.
It handles that for you.

Then you can first log out the nodes to see it in action:

```js
const visit = require('unist-util-visit')

module.exports = () => (tree, file) => {
  visit(tree, 'heading', node => {
    console.log(node)
  })
}
```

This will log out all the nodes in your document that are headings.
Inside heading nodes there are text nodes.
These include the raw text included in the heading.

<Note>
  The reason that heading nodes include multiple text node types is because
  there can be other “[phrasing content][phrasing]” nodes.
  For example if your heading looked like `# Hello, _world_`.
  In addition to the text there is also an emphasis node.
</Note>

## Visiting text nodes

To walk the text nodes, you can use `unist-util-visit` again:

```js
const visit = require('unist-util-visit')

module.exports = () => (tree, file) => {
  visit(tree, 'heading', node => {
    visit(node, 'text', textNode => {
      console.log(textNode)
    })
  })
}
```

## Using the title library

Now that you are logging out the text nodes, you can now manipulate them with
the title library by reassigning the value to the node:

```js
const title = require('title')
const visit = require('unist-util-visit')

module.exports = () => (tree, file) => {
  visit(tree, 'heading', node => {
    visit(node, 'text', textNode => {
      const text = textNode.value ? textNode.value.trim() : ''
      textNode.value = title(text)
    })
  })
}
```
