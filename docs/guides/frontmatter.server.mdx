# Frontmatter

This guide explores how to support YAML frontmatter in markdown and MDX.
MDX supports standard markdown syntax ([CommonMark][]).
That means frontmatter is not supported by default.
MDX also comes with support for ESM (import/exports) which is a powerful dynamic
alternative.

Say we have this file:

```mdx path="post.mdx"
export const name = 'World'
export const title = 'Hi, ' + name + '!'

# {title}
```

Used like so:

```js path="example.js"
import * as Post from './post.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

console.log(Post.title) // Prints 'Hi, World!'
```

Still, you might prefer frontmatter because it lets you define data that can be
extracted from files *without* (or before) compiling:

Say our MDX with frontmatter looked like this:

```mdx path="post.mdx"
---
title: Hi, World!
---

# Hi, World!
```

Then without compiling or evaluating that file the metadata can be accessed like
so:

```js path="example.js"
import {promises as fs} from 'node:fs'
import yaml from 'js-yaml'

main()

async function main() {
  console.log(yaml.loadAll(await fs.readFile('post.mdx'))[0]) // Prints `{title: 'Hi, World!'}`
}
```

`@mdx-js/mdx` doesn’t understand YAML frontmatter by default but can understand
it using [`remark-frontmatter`][remark-frontmatter]:

```js path="example.js"
import {promises as fs} from 'node:fs'
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter'
import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

main()

async function main() {
  console.log(
    await compile(await fs.readFile('post.mdx'), {
      remarkPlugins: [remarkFrontmatter]
    })
  )
}
```

Now it “works”: the frontmatter is ignored.
But it’s not available from *inside* the MDX.
What if we wanted to use frontmatter from inside the MDX file too?
Like so?

```mdx path="post.mdx"
---
title: Hi, World!
---

# {frontmatter.title}
```

That’s what
[`remark-mdx-frontmatter`][remark-mdx-frontmatter]
does.
