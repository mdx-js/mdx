# Transform content

With MDX you can interact with or manipulate raw MDX content.
Since MDX is a part of the [unified][] ecosystem, there
are many utilities you can use to work with MDX.

You can utilize [to-vfile][] to read and write MDX files
and you can leverage [remark][] and [remark-mdx][]
to parse and process MDX content.
The remark-mdx library is a parsing extension to enhance the Markdown [AST][] to
understand MDX (resulting in [MDXAST][]), giving you access and insight to MDX
attributes, namely imports, exports, and jsx.

Letâ€™s see an example of what we have explained so far.

Say we have the following file, `example.mdx`:

```mdx
import Component from 'Component'

export const meta = {
  prop: 'value'
}

# Title

Content.

<Component />
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
const {read, write} = require('to-vfile')
const remark = require('remark')
const mdx = require('remark-mdx')

;(async () => {
  const path = './example.mdx'
  const file = await read(path)
  const contents = await remark()
    .use(mdx)
    .use(() => tree => {
      console.log(tree)
    })
    .process(file)

  await write({
    path,
    contents
  })
})()
```

Now, running `node example.js` yields:

```js
{
  type: "root",
  children: [
    {
      type: "import",
      value: "import Component from 'Component';",
      position: [Object]
    },
    {
      type: "export",
      value: "export const meta = {\n    prop: 'value'\n};",
      position: [Object]
    },
    { type: "heading", depth: 1, children: [Array], position: [Object] },
    { type: "paragraph", children: [Array], position: [Object] },
    { type: "jsx", value: "<Component />", position: [Object] }
  ],
  position: {
    start: { line: 1, column: 1, offset: 0 },
    end: { line: 12, column: 1, offset: 113 }
  }
}
```

From here, you can continue to [write your own plugin][writing-a-plugin] or use
[remark plugins][remark-plugins] to manipulate MDX content.

This technique allows you to use things like [remark-toc][] to add a
generated table of contents based on the other content in the MDX file or
[remark-mdx-metadata][] to externally modify MDX metadata and
save the modified content back to the original file.
