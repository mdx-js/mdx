# TypeScript

MDX provides typings for many of the core packages.

If you want to improve upon the types, we would *love* a PR to
improve the developer experience for TypeScript users.

* * *

## Typings for Components and Utilities

*  \\\\\\\\\\`@mdx-js/mdx`
*  \\\\\\\\\\`@mdx-js/react`
*  \\\\\\\\\\`@mdx-js/runtime`
*  \\\\\\\\\\`@mdx-js/vue`

Include types, no additional setup needed.

## Typings for MDX imports

### React and Webpack

Add an *mdx.d.ts* file with the below content, and ensure it is included by the *tsconfig.json*.

```tsx
/// <reference types="@mdx-js/loader" />
```

### Vue and Webpack

Add an *mdx.d.ts* file with the below content, and ensure it is included by the *tsconfig.json*.

```tsx
/// <reference types="@mdx-js/vue-loader" />
```
