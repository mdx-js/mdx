# TypeScript

MDX provides typings for many of the core packages.

If you want to improve upon the types, we would *love* a PR to
improve the developer experience for TypeScript users.

## Typings for Components and Utilities

*   `@mdx-js/mdx`
*   `@mdx-js/preact`
*   `@mdx-js/react`
*   `@mdx-js/runtime`
*   `@mdx-js/vue`
*   `remark-mdx`

Include types, no additional setup needed.

## Typings for MDX imports

### React and Webpack

Add an `mdx.d.ts` file with the below content, and ensure it is included by the
`tsconfig.json`.

```tsx
/// <reference types="@mdx-js/loader" />
```

### Vue and Webpack

Add an `mdx.d.ts` file with the below content, and ensure it is included by the
`tsconfig.json`.

```tsx
/// <reference types="@mdx-js/vue-loader" />
```
