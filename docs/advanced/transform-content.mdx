# Transform Content

With MDX you can interact with or manipulate raw MDX content.
Since MDX is a part of the [unified][] ecosystem, there
are many utilities you can use to work with MDX.

You can utilize [to-vfile][] to read and write MDX files
and you can leverage [remark][] and [remark-mdx][]
to parse and process MDX content.  The remark-mdx library is a parsing
extension to enhance the Markdown [AST][] to understand MDX
(resulting in [MDXAST][]), giving you access and insight to MDX
attributes, namely imports, exports, and jsx.

Let’s see an example of what we have explained so far.

Say we have the following file, `example.mdx`:

```md
import Component from 'Component';

export const meta = {
    prop: 'value'
};

# Title

Content.

<Component />
```

And our script, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
const {read, write} = require('to-vfile')
const remark = require('remark');
const mdx = require('remark-mdx');

(async () => {
    const path = './example.mdx';
    const file = await read(path);
    const contents = await remark()
        .use(mdx)
        .use(() => (tree) => {
            console.log(tree)
        })
        .process(file);

    await write({
        path,
        contents
    })
})();
```

Now, running `node example.js` yields:

```js
{
  type: "root",
  children: [
    {
      type: "import",
      value: "import Component from 'Component';",
      position: [Object]
    },
    {
      type: "export",
      value: "export const meta = {\n    prop: 'value'\n};",
      position: [Object]
    },
    { type: "heading", depth: 1, children: [Array], position: [Object] },
    { type: "paragraph", children: [Array], position: [Object] },
    { type: "jsx", value: "<Component />", position: [Object] }
  ],
  position: {
    start: { line: 1, column: 1, offset: 0 },
    end: { line: 12, column: 1, offset: 113 }
  }
}
```

From here, you can continue to [write your own plugin][writing-a-plugin] or use
[remark plugins][remark-plugins] to manipulate MDX content.

This technique allows you to use things like [remark-toc][] to add a
generated table of contents based on the other content in the MDX file or
[remark-mdx-metadata][] to externally modify MDX metadata and
save the modified content back to the original file.
