# Shortcodes

An exciting new feature in MDX v1 is global shortcodes.
This allows you to expose components to all of your documents in your app or
website.
This is a useful feature for common components like YouTube embeds, Twitter
cards, or anything else frequently used in your documents.

If you have an application wrapper for your MDX documents
you can add in components with the `MDXProvider`:

```js path="src/App.js"
import React from 'react'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import {YouTube, Twitter, TomatoBox} from './ui'

const shortcodes = {YouTube, Twitter, TomatoBox}

export default ({children}) => (
  <MDXProvider components={shortcodes}>{children}</MDXProvider>
)
```

Then, any MDX document thatâ€™s wrapped in `App` has access to `YouTube`,
`Twitter`, and `TomatoBox`.
Shortcodes are nothing more than components, so you can reference them anywhere
in an MDX document with JSX.

```mdx path="example.mdx"
# Hello world!

Hereâ€™s a YouTube shortcode:

<YouTube tweetId="1234" />

Hereâ€™s a YouTube shortcode wrapped in TomatoBox:

<TomatoBox>
  <YouTube videoId="1234" />
</TomatoBox>
```

Thatâ€™s it.
