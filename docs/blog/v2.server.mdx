# MDX v2

It’s been 4 years since this project was announced.
2½ since we released our stable version 1.
A lot of hard work has now led to a much improved version 2.
Here’s the highlights:

<div className="emoji-list">
  *   📝 **Improved syntax** makes it easier to use markdown in JSX in
      markdown
  *   🧑‍💻 **JavaScript expressions** turn `{2 * Math.PI}` into {2 * Math.PI}
  *   🔌 New **esbuild**, **Rollup**, and **Node.js** integrations
  *   ⚛️ **Any JSX runtime**: React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, you name it, it all
      works
  *   🌳 **Improved AST** exposes info on documents in great detail
  *   🏃‍♀️ Compiles at least **25% faster**
  *   🚴 Generated code runs twice as fast (**100% faster**)
  *   🚄 Bundle size is more than three times as small (**250% smaller**)
  *   🧵 …and much, much, so much more

## Improvements to the MDX format

We’ve spent a lot of time thinking and trying out different ways to improve the
format.
Originally, the format was very close to how markdown, and HTML in markdown,
works.
We found that the old behavior often yielded unexpected results.
In v2 we shift the format a little bit closer to how JS(X) works.

Take for example this MDX file:

```html chrome=no
<div>*hi*?</div>

<div>
  # hi?
</div>

<main>
  <div>

    # hi?

  </div>
</main>
```

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    In v1, that was equivalent to the following JSX:

    ```jsx chrome=no
    <>
      <div>*hi*?</div>
      <div>
        # hi?
      </div>
      <main>
        <div>
          <pre><code># hi?</code></pre>
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    In v2, it’s equivalent to the following JSX:

    ```jsx chrome=no
    <>
      <div><em>hi</em>?</div>
      <div>
        <h1>hi?</h1>
      </div>
      <main>
        <div>
          <h1>hi?</h1>
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
    ```
  </div>
</div>

We believe it’s more intuitive that markdown “inlines” such as emphasis can form
between tags on the same line (first `<div>`), “blocks” such as headings can
form if they’re on their own line (second `<div>`), and indentation is allowed
rather than forming code (third `<div>`).

We also added JavaScript expressions to the MDX format:

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    ```jsx path="expressions.mdx" language="mdx" copy=no
    export const authors = [
      {name: 'Jane', email: 'hi@jane.com'},
      {name: 'John', twitter: '@john2002'}
    ]
    export const published = new Date('2021-11-01')

    Written by: {new Intl.ListFormat('en').format(authors.map(d => d.name))}.

    Published on: {new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {dateStyle: 'long'}).format(published)}.
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    ```jsx path="equivalent.jsx" copy=no
    <>
      <p>Written by: Jane and John.</p>
      <p>Published on: November 1, 2021.</p>
    </>
    ```
  </div>
</div>

The format is described in [§ What is MDX?][what]

## Rollup, esbuild, and other integrations

When we started out, Babel, webpack, and React were ubiquitous in the JavaScript
ecosystem and we built MDX on them.
For version 2, we’ve worked hard to make it easier to use MDX without them and
with other tools.

On the bundler size, we’ve added new integrations: `@mdx-js/esbuild` for
esbuild which is extremely fast as it’s written in Go, and `@mdx-js/rollup` for
Rollup which is a bundler that’s also used in Vite and WMR.
You can also import MDX files directly in Node.js with `@mdx-js/node-loader`.

On the framework side, we now compile all JSX away for you to normal JavaScript
and no longer require any framework-specific code to glue it together with MDX.
Now any JSX runtime, whether
[classic or automatic](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html)
is supported.
This means MDX can work with React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, Theme UI, Ink, you
name it!
Plus anything that’s yet to be invented.

See [§ Getting started][getting-started] to make a quick start but also for
in-depth information on how to integrate MDX with many different tools.

## Architectural improvements

To make the syntax of the MDX format better and to allow new integrations and
arbitrary JSX runtimes, we’ve rewritten almost everything.
Part of that effort was [micromark][], which is another story, but it means
we’re fully CommonMark (and optionally GFM) compliant, while also understanding
more about MDX files.

Now we can throw an early error when there’s a typo and point to exactly where
it happened, instead of a tool like webpack complaining about an error in an
intermediate, unrecognizable, and broken string of JavaScript.
It also means that we have a new AST which describes the MDX syntax in more
detail — we even expose the embedded JavaScript.
This detailed AST allows plugins to more easily enhance MDX in powerful new
ways.
It also helped solve many edge cases where MDX would previously crash.
And it let us drop Babel.

A nice side effect of the new architecture is that it also resulted in a
**400% smaller bundle size**, that compilation is at least **25% faster**, and
that the generated code runs **200% faster**.

See [§ Architecture][architecture] for how `@mdx-js/mdx` works.
See [`remark-mdx`][remark-mdx] for more on the AST and see
[§ Extending MDX][extending] for several plugins that use the new tree to
enhance MDX.

## Project improvements

*   plain markdown support
*   fully typed with typescript and completely covered by tests
*   new website with rewritten documentation and new guides
*   some stuff about RSC and how the site is made with them?

Now, we think it’s ready.
**We’re happy to finally release v2!**

## 📈 Growth

A major release is always a good time to take a step back and reflect on what’s
been happening in terms of growth and the greater community.
The ecosystem surrounding MDX has already grown larger than we ever dreamed.
We’ve also seen projects/products/application we never even imagined.
