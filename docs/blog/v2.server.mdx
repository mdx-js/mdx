Years of hard work have led to a much improved version 2.
Here’s the highlights:

## Improvements to the MDX format

We’ve spent a lot of time thinking and trying out different ways to improve the
format.
Originally, the format was very close to how markdown, and HTML in markdown,
works.
We found that the old behavior often yielded unexpected results.
In version 2, we shift the format a little bit closer to how JS(X) works.

Take for example this MDX file:

```html chrome=no
<div>*hi*?</div>

<div>
  # hi?
</div>

<main>
  <div>

    # hi?

  </div>
</main>
```

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    In version 1, that was equivalent to the following JSX:

    ```jsx chrome=no
    <>
      <div>*hi*?</div>
      <div>
        # hi?
      </div>
      <main>
        <div>
          <pre><code># hi?</code></pre>
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    In version 2, it’s equivalent to the following JSX:

    ```jsx chrome=no
    <>
      <div><em>hi</em>?</div>
      <div>
        <h1>hi?</h1>
      </div>
      <main>
        <div>
          <h1>hi?</h1>
        </div>
      </main>
    </>
    ```
  </div>
</div>

We believe it’s more intuitive that markdown “inlines” such as emphasis can form
between tags on the same line (first `<div>`), “blocks” such as headings can
form if they’re on their own line (second `<div>`), and indentation is allowed
rather than forming code (third `<div>`).

We also added support for JavaScript expressions, take for example:

<div className="big-columns">
  <div>
    ```jsx path="expressions.mdx" language="mdx" copy=no
    export const authors = [
      {name: 'Jane', email: 'hi@jane.com'},
      {name: 'John', twitter: '@john2002'}
    ]
    export const published = new Date('2021-11-01')

    Written by: {new Intl.ListFormat('en').format(authors.map(d => d.name))}.

    Published on: {new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en', {dateStyle: 'long'}).format(published)}.
    ```
  </div>

  <div>
    ```jsx path="equivalent.jsx" copy=no
    <>
      <p>Written by: Jane and John.</p>
      <p>Published on: November 1, 2021.</p>
    </>
    ```
  </div>
</div>

As the format moves a little further from markdown towards JSX, we’ve added
support for loading “normal” markdown without our syntax extensions.
If you’re using our bundler integration `@mdx-js/loader` (or `@mdx-js/rollup`,
`@mdx-js/esbuild`, or `@mdx-js/node-loader`, see next section), then that’ll
just work: import `readme.mdx` and it’s seen as the MDX format, import
`readme.md` and it’s seen as markdown, based on their extensions.

The MDX format is described in [§ What is MDX?][what]

## Rollup, esbuild, and other integrations

When we started out, Babel, webpack, and React were ubiquitous in the JavaScript
ecosystem and we built MDX on them.
For version 2, we worked hard to make them optional.
They’re no longer required and MDX can more easily be used with other tools.

On the bundler side, we’ve added new integrations: `@mdx-js/esbuild` for
esbuild (an extremely fast bundler) and `@mdx-js/rollup` for Rollup (a bundler
that’s also used in Vite and WMR).
You can even import MDX files directly in Node.js with our new
`@mdx-js/node-loader`.

On the runtime side, we can now compile JSX away to normal JavaScript and
no longer need framework-specific code to glue them together with MDX.
Now any JSX runtime, whether [classic or automatic][jsx-runtime], is supported.
This means MDX can be used with React, Preact, Vue, Emotion, Theme UI, Ink, you
name it, plus anything that’s yet to be invented!

See [§ Getting started][getting-started] for a quick start but also in-depth
info on how to integrate MDX with many different tools.

## Architectural improvements

To make the syntax of the MDX format better and to allow new integrations and
arbitrary JSX runtimes, we’ve rewritten almost everything.
Part of that effort was [micromark][], which is another story, but it means
we’re fully CommonMark (and optionally GFM) compliant, while also understanding
more about MDX files.

Now we can throw an early error when there’s a typo and point to exactly where
it happened, instead of a later bundler like webpack complaining about an error
in an intermediate, unrecognizable, and broken string of JavaScript.
It also means that we have a new AST which describes the MDX syntax in more
detail — we even expose the embedded JavaScript.
This detailed AST allows plugins to enhance MDX in powerful new ways.
It also helped solve edge cases where MDX would previously crash.
And it let us drop Babel.

This new architecture results in **25% faster** compilation, generated code
that runs twice as fast (**100% faster**), and that the bundle size of
`@mdx-js/mdx` is more than three times as small (**250% smaller**).

See [¶ Architecture in `@mdx-js/mdx`][architecture] for more on how our compiler
works.
See [§ Extending MDX][extending] for several plugins that use the new tree to
enhance MDX, how to use them and other plugins, and how to create plugins.

## TypeScript

All [`@mdx-js/*` packages][packages] are now fully typed with [TypeScript][]
through JSDoc comments.
That means our APIs are exposed as TypeScript types but also that our projects
are type safe internally.

We’ve published [`@types/mdx`][types-mdx], a types-only package that can be used
with any (community) integration.
You can use it, if you’re importing MDX files, to type those imported
components.

See [¶ TypeScript in § Getting started][ts] for more on how to use configure
TypeScript.

## Docs & site

MDX is used and liked a lot.
Before version 1 we had amassed a total of **2.5m downloads**.
Now we hit that number every week.
Our core compiler `@mdx-js/mdx` is used in **61k projects**.
Our GitHub repo has **11.6k stars**.

Many people help, often with docs.
85 contributors committed to our repo since version 1.
We’re grateful for these contributions and all those individual insights,
but over the years it did result in some inconsistencies and duplicated content.

For version 2, we rewrote our docs from beginning to end to tell a consistent
story for new users, folks wanting to do complex AST and compiler stuff, and
anyone in between.

We also made a new website.
It’s built on MDX of course, [unified][] itself, and [React Server Components
(RSC)][rsc].
While we have to dogfood the former two as they’re projects we maintain, and the
latter is extremely experimental, we think compiling things ahead of time and
betting on hybrid models, compared to completely server-side sites or completely
client-side apps, is the smart choice for us and the web’s future.

Our new site is heavily optimized and fast, gorgeous (subjective but hey), has
rich metadata, and scores very well in performance and accessibility review
tools such as Lighthouse and axe.
