# Getting started

This article explains how to integrate MDX into your project.
It shows how to use MDX with your bundler and JSX runtime of choice. {/* more */}
To understand how the MDX format works, we recommend that you start with
[§ What is MDX][what].
See [§ Using MDX][use] when you’re all set up and ready to use MDX.

    *   [JavaScript engines](#javascript-engines)
*   [Further reading](#further-reading)

## Prerequisites

MDX relies on JSX, so it’s required that your project supports JSX as well.
Any JSX runtime (React, Preact, Vue, etc.) will do.
Note that we do compile JSX to JavaScript for you so you don’t have to set that
up.

All `@mdx-js/*` packages are written in modern JavaScript.
A [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version of 12.20, 14.14, 16.0, or later is
required to use them.
Our packages are also [ESM only][esm], so they have to be `import`ed instead of
`require`d.

## Quick start

### Bundler

MDX is a language that’s compiled to JavaScript.
(We also compile regular markdown to JavaScript.)
The easiest way to get started is to use an integration for your bundler if you
have one:

*   If you’re using **esbuild**,
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/esbuild`][mdx-esbuild]
*   If you’re using **Rollup**
    (or Vite or WMR, which use it),
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-rollup]
*   If you’re using **webpack**
    (or Create React App (CRA), Next.js, or Vue CLI, which use it),
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader]

You can also use MDX if you’re not using a bundler:

*   If you want to import MDX files in **Node.js**, you can
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/node-loader`][mdx-node-loader]
*   Otherwise, you can install and use the core compiler
    [`@mdx-js/mdx`][mdx-mdx] to manually compile MDX files
*   Finally, it’s also possible to evaluate (compile *and run*) MDX anywhere,
    with [`evaluate` from `@mdx-js/mdx`][evaluate].

For more info on the aforementioned tools, please see their dedicated sections:
[¶ Create React App (CRA)][cra], [¶ esbuild][esbuild],
[¶ Next.js][next], [¶ Node.js][node],
[¶ Rollup][rollup], [¶ Vite][vite], [¶ Vue CLI][vue-cli],
[¶ WMR][wmr], [¶ webpack][webpack].

There are also community driven integrations.
As we’ve just hit a major milestone with v2, they might be out of date with our
v2 docs though.
See:
[¶ Docusaurus][docusaurus],
[¶ Gatsby][gatsby],
[¶ Parcel][parcel],
[¶ Razzle][razzle],
[¶ React Static][react-static], and
[¶ Snowpack][snowpack].

  <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/#related>
*/}

<a name="mdxprovider" />

### JSX

Now you’ve set up an integration or `@mdx-js/mdx` itself, it’s time to configure
your JSX runtime.

*   If you’re using **React**,
    you don’t need to do anything.
    Optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react]
*   If you’re using **Preact**,
    set [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] to `'preact'`.
    Optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/preact`][mdx-preact]
*   If you’re using **Svelte**,
    install [`svelte-jsx`][svelte-jsx].
    Set [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] to `'svelte-jsx'`.
*   If you’re using **Vue 3**,
    set [`options.jsx`][options-jsx] to `true`.
    Then use Babel alongside your MDX integration (which is possible with
    webpack and Rollup but not esbuild) and configure it to use
    [`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next/tree/dev/packages/babel-plugin-jsx).
    Optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/vue`][mdx-vue]
*   If you’re using **Emotion**,
    set [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] to
    `'@emotion/react'`
*   If you’re using **Theme UI**,
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react].
    Then wrap your MDX content in a `<ThemeProvider />`

Other JSX runtimes are supported by setting
[`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource].
See also the different options there on how to use the classic JSX runtime
and how to define a `pragma` and `pragmaFrag` for it.

For more info on the aforementioned tools, please see their dedicated sections:
[¶ Emotion][emotion],
[¶ Preact][preact],
[¶ React][react],
[¶ Svelte][svelte],
[¶ Theme UI][themeui], or
[¶ Vue][vue].

### Editor

Once everything is set up in your project, you can enhance the experience by
adding support for MDX in your editor:

*   With **VS Code**,
    try [`silvenon/vscode-mdx`](https://github.com/silvenon/vscode-mdx)
    and/or [`xyc/vscode-mdx-preview`](https://github.com/xyc/vscode-mdx-preview)
*   With **Vim**,
    try [`jxnblk/vim-mdx-js`](https://github.com/jxnblk/vim-mdx-js)
*   With **Sublime Text**,
    try [`jonsuh/mdx-sublime`](https://github.com/jonsuh/mdx-sublime)
*   With **JetBrains IntelliJ/WebStorm**,
    try [`valentinnodan/mdx-intellij-plugin`](https://github.com/valentinnodan/mdx-intellij-plugin)

<Note type="info">
  **Note**: we’re looking for help with emacs and others!
</Note>

### Types

<details>
  <summary>Expand example of typed imports</summary>

  First install the package:

  ```sh
  npm install @types/mdx
  ```

  …TypeScript should automatically pick it up:

  ```js path="example.js"
  import Post from './post.mdx' // `Post` is now typed.
  ```
</details>

All our APIs are fully typed with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

To enable types for imported `.mdx`, `.md`, etcetera files, you should make sure
the TypeScript `JSX` namespace is typed.
This is done by installing and using the types of your framework, such as
[`@types/react`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/react).
Then you can install and use
[`@types/mdx`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/mdx),
which adds types to import statements of supported files.

### Security

Please note that MDX is a programming language.
If you trust your authors, that’s fine.
But be extremely careful with user content and don’t let random people from the
internet write MDX.
If you do, you might want to look into using `<iframe>`s with `sandbox`, but
security is hard, and that doesn’t seem to be 100%.
For Node, [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) sounds interesting.
But you should probably also sandbox the whole OS using Docker or similar,
perform rate limiting, and make sure processes can be killed when taking too
long.

## Integrations

### Bundlers

#### esbuild

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  import esbuild from 'esbuild'

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

We support [webpack](https://webpack.js.org).
Install and configure the webpack loader [`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader].
[Configure your JSX runtime][jsx] depending on which one you use (React, Preact,
Vue, etc.)

If you use more modern JavaScript features than what your users support,
[install and configure `babel-loader`](/packages/loader/#note-babel).

See also [¶ Create React App (CRA)][cra], [¶ Next.js][next], and
[¶ Vue CLI][vue-cli], if you’re using webpack through them, for more info.

### Build systems

#### Snowpack

[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev) has their own plugin to support MDX.
See [`snowpack-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/jaredLunde/snowpack-plugin-mdx)
on how to use MDX with Snowpack.

#### Vite

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="vite.config.js"
  import {defineConfig} from 'vite'
  import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      mdx(/* jsxImportSource: …, otherOptions… */)
    ]
  })
  ```
</details>

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) supports Rollup plugins directly in `plugins` in
your `vite.config.js`.

Install and configure the Rollup plugin [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-rollup].

If you use more modern JavaScript features than what your users support,
[configure Vite’s
`build.target`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#browser-compatibility).

See also [¶ Rollup][rollup], which is used in Vite, and see [¶ Vue][vue], if
you’re using that, for more info.

#### Vue CLI

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="vue.config.js"
  module.exports = {
    chainWebpack: config => {
      config.module
        .rule('mdx')
        .test(/\.mdx?$/)
        .use('babel-loader')
          .loader('babel-loader')
          .options({plugins: ['@vue/babel-plugin-jsx'], /* Other options… */})
          .end()
        .use('@mdx-js/loader')
          .loader('@mdx-js/loader')
          .options({jsx: true, /* otherOptions… */})
          .end()
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

[Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org), in the beta for version 5, supports webpack
loaders directly in `configureWebpack.plugins` in `vue.config.js`.

Install and configure the webpack loader [`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader].
You have to configure [Vue and Babel][vue] too.

See also [¶ webpack][webpack], which is used in Vue CLI, and see [¶ Vue][vue],
which you’re likely using, for more info.

<Note type="info">
  **Note**: to support ESM in `vue.config.js` or `vue.config.mjs`, you currently
  have to use their v5.0.0-rc.
  See [`v5.0.0-beta.0`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/releases/tag/v5.0.0-beta.0)
  in their changelog for more info.
  Their latest beta release is currently `v5.0.0-rc.2`.
</Note>

#### WMR

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="wmr.config.mjs"
  import {defineConfig} from 'wmr'
  import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      mdx({/* jsxImportSource: …, otherOptions… */})
    ]
  })
  ```
</details>

[WMR](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr) supports Rollup plugins directly by
[adding them to `plugins`](https://wmr.dev/docs/plugins/) in `wmr.config.mjs`.

Install and configure the Rollup plugin [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-rollup].

See also [¶ Rollup][rollup], which is used in WMR, and see [¶ Preact][preact],
if you’re using that, for more info.

### Compilers

#### Babel

<details>
  <summary>Expand plugin and sample use</summary>

  This plugin:

  ```js path="plugin.js"
  import path from 'node:path'
  import parser from '@babel/parser'
  import estreeToBabel from 'estree-to-babel'
  import {compileSync} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

  export function babelPluginSyntaxMdx() {
    // Tell Babel to use a different parser.
    return {parserOverride: babelParserWithMdx}
  }

  // A Babel parser that parses MDX files with `@mdx-js/mdx` and passes any
  // other things through to the normal Babel parser.
  function babelParserWithMdx(value, options) {
    if (
      options.sourceFilename &&
      /\.mdx?$/.test(path.extname(options.sourceFilename))
    ) {
      // Babel does not support async parsers, unfortunately.
      return compileSync(
        {value, path: options.sourceFilename},
        // Tell `@mdx-js/mdx` to return a Babel tree instead of serialized JS.
        {recmaPlugins: [recmaBabel], /* jsxImportSource: …, otherOptions… */}
      ).result
    }

    return parser.parse(value, options)
  }

  // A “recma” plugin is a unified plugin that runs on the estree (used by
  // `@mdx-js/mdx` and much of the JS ecosystem but not Babel).
  // This plugin defines `'estree-to-babel'` as the compiler, which means that
  // the resulting Babel tree is given back by `compileSync`.
  function recmaBabel() {
    Object.assign(this, {Compiler: estreeToBabel})
  }
  ```

  Can be used like so with the Babel API:

  ```js path="example.js"
  import babel from '@babel/core'
  import {babelPluginSyntaxMdx} from './plugin.js'

  // Note that a filename must be set for our plugin to know it’s MDX instead of JS.
  await babel.transformAsync(file, {filename: 'example.mdx', plugins: [babelPluginSyntaxMdx]})
  ```
</details>

You should probably use webpack or Rollup instead of Babel directly as that
gives the neatest interface.
It is possible to use `@mdx-js/mdx` in Babel and it’s fast, because it skips
`@mdx-js/mdx` serialization and Babel parsing, if Babel is used anyway.

Babel does not support syntax extensions to its parser (it has “syntax” plugins
but those in fact turn certain flags on or off).
It does support setting a different parser.
Which in turn lets us choose whether to use the `@mdx-js/mdx` or
`@babel/parser`.

### Site generators

#### Create React App (CRA)

<Note type="info">
  **Note**: rewiring with CRACO (see below) is currently required for CRA 5,
  due to a bug in `react-scripts`
  ([`facebook/create-react-app#12166`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/12166)),
  which is also tracked at
  [`mdx-js/mdx#1870`](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/discussions/1870).
</Note>

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```mdx path="src/content.mdx"
  # Hello, world!

  This is **markdown** with <span style={{color: "red"}}>JSX</span>: MDX!
  ```

  ```jsx path="src/App.jsx"
  /* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */
  import Content from '!@mdx-js/loader!./content.mdx'

  export default function App() {
    return <Content />
  }
  ```
</details>

[CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) supports webpack loaders
through webpack loader syntax in imports.

Install the webpack loader [`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader].

<details>
  <summary>Expand CRACO example</summary>

  ```js path="craco.config.js"
  const {addAfterLoader, loaderByName} = require('@craco/craco')

  module.exports = {
    webpack: {
      configure(webpackConfig) {
        addAfterLoader(webpackConfig, loaderByName('babel-loader'), {
          test: /\.mdx?$/,
          loader: require.resolve('@mdx-js/loader')
        })
        return webpackConfig
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ```jsx path="src/App.jsx"
  import Content from './content.mdx'

  export default function App() {
    return <Content />
  }
  ```
</details>

For importing MDX without the `!@mdx-js/loader!` prefix, you can add
the loader to the webpack config, by rewiring `react-scripts` using
[CRACO](http://github.com/gsoft-inc/craco).

<Note type="info">
  **Note**: warnings about CRACO having
  `incorrect peer dependency "react-scripts@^4.0.0"`
  can be ignored for the above to work.
</Note>

See also [¶ Webpack][webpack], which is used in CRA, and see [¶ React][react],
which you’re likely using, for more info.

#### Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) supports MDX by default.
See [MDX and React](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/react)
on their website for more on how to use MDX with Docusaurus.

#### Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) has their own plugin to support MDX.
See [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/)
on how to use MDX with Gatsby.

#### Next.js

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="next.config.js"
  import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'

  const withMDX = nextMDX({
    // By default only the .mdx extension is supported.
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {/* providerImportSource: …, otherOptions… */}
  })

  export default withMDX({
    // Support MDX files as pages:
    pageExtensions: ['md', 'mdx', 'tsx', 'ts', 'jsx', 'js'],
  })
  ```
</details>

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) has its own package to support MDX.

Install and configure [`@next/mdx`][@next/mdx].
There is no need to configure your JSX runtime as React is already set up.

The MDX provider can be configured in [`pages/_app.js`][next-app].
In order to use it, you need to configure the `providerImportSource` as
well.

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="next.config.js"
  import nextMDX from '@next/mdx'

  const withMDX = nextMDX({
    // By default only the .mdx extension is supported.
    extension: /\.mdx?$/,
    options: {providerImportSource: '@mdx-js/react',  /* otherOptions… */}
  })

  export default withMDX({
    // Support MDX files as pages:
    pageExtensions: ['md', 'mdx', 'tsx', 'ts', 'jsx', 'js'],
  })
  ```

  ```jsx path="pages/_app.js"
  import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
  import {Header} from '../components/Header.js'

  const components = {
    h1: Header
  }

  export default function App({Component, pageProps}) {
    return (
      <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </MDXProvider>
    )
  }
  ```
</details>

See [Using MDX with Next.js][next-mdx] for more details.

#### Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is built on [islands architecture](https://docs.astro.build/concepts/islands/),
allowing you to use React, Vue, Svelte, and more within your MDX files.

After [creating your first Astro project](https://astro.new/), you can [add the MDX integration](https://docs.astro.build/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/):

```sh
astro add mdx
# Or use `npx` on Windows
npx astro add mdx
```

And (optionally) add your favorite component framework(s).
You can import Markdown, Astro, and other MDX files as components
out-of-the-box.

```sh
astro add preact
# Or use `npx` on Windows
npx astro add preact
```

To learn how to configure layouts, support YAML frontmatter, and set up Astro’s
syntax highlighting, [see Astro’s guide on their MDX
integration](https://docs.astro.build/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/).

#### Parcel

[Parcel 2](https://v2.parceljs.org) has their own plugin to support MDX.
See [`@parcel/transformer-mdx`](https://v2.parceljs.org/languages/mdx/)
on how to use MDX with Parcel.

#### Razzle

[Razzle](https://razzlejs.org) has their own plugin to support MDX.
See [`razzle-plugin-mdx`](https://razzlejs.org/plugins/razzle-plugin-mdx)
on how to use MDX with Razzle.

#### React Static

[React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/) has their own
plugin to support MDX.
See [`react-static-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/react-static/react-static/tree/HEAD/packages/react-static-plugin-mdx)
on how to use MDX with React Static.

### JSX runtimes

#### Emotion

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

  const js = String(await compile('# hi', {jsxImportSource: '@emotion/react', /* otherOptions… */}))
  ```
</details>

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) is supported when
[`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] is set to
`'@emotion/react'`.
You can optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react], which
allows for context based component passing.

See also [¶ React][react], which is used in Emotion, and see
[¶ Rollup][rollup] and [¶ webpack][webpack], if you’re using them, for more
info.

#### Ink

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```mdx path="example.mdx"
  # Hi!
  ```

  ```js path="example.js"
  import React from 'react'
  import {render, Text} from 'ink'
  import Content from './example.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

  const components = {
    h1(props) {
      return React.createElement(Text, {bold: true, ...props})
    },
    p: Text
  }

  render(React.createElement(Content, {components}))
  ```

  Can be used with:

  ```sh
  node --experimental-loader=@mdx-js/node-loader example.js
  ```
</details>

[Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) uses the React JSX runtime,
so set that up.
You will also want to swap HTML elements out for Ink’s components.
See [§ Table of components](/table-of-components/) for what those are and Ink’s
documentation on what you can replace them with.

See also [¶ React][react] and [¶ Node.js][node], which you’re using, for
more info.

#### Preact

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

  const js = String(await compile('# hi', {jsxImportSource: 'preact', /* otherOptions… */}))
  ```
</details>

Preact is supported when [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] is
set to `'preact'`.
You can optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/preact`][mdx-preact], which
allows for context based component passing.

See also [¶ esbuild][esbuild], [¶ Rollup][rollup], and [¶ webpack][webpack],
which you might be using, for more info.

#### React

React is supported right out of the box.
You can optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react], which
allows for context based component passing.

See also [¶ esbuild][esbuild], [¶ Rollup][rollup], and [¶ webpack][webpack],
which you might be using, for more info.

<Note type="info">
  **Experiment**: while currently in alpha and not shipping soon,
  **React server components** will work with MDX too.
  There is an
  [experimental demo](https://wooorm.com/server-components-mdx-demo/).
  And our website is made with them!

#### Theme UI

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  Example w/o `@mdx-js/react`

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {base} from '@theme-ui/preset-base'
  import {components, ThemeProvider} from 'theme-ui'
  import Post from './post.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

  <ThemeProvider theme={base}>
    <Post components={components} />
  </ThemeProvider>
  ```

  Example w/ `@mdx-js/react`

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {base} from '@theme-ui/preset-base'
  import {ThemeProvider} from 'theme-ui'
  import Post from './post.mdx' // Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX -> JS.

  <ThemeProvider theme={base}>
    <Post />
  </ThemeProvider>
  ```
</details>

[Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) is a React-specific library that requires using
context to access its effective components.
You can optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react], which
allows for context based component passing.

See also [¶ Emotion][emotion], [¶ React][react], [¶ esbuild][esbuild],
[¶ Rollup][rollup], and [¶ webpack][webpack], which you might be using, for more
info.

#### Svelte

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

  const js = String(await compile('# hi', {jsxImportSource: 'svelte-jsx', /* otherOptions… */}))
  ```
</details>

Svelte is supported when [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] is
set to `'svelte-jsx'`, which is a [small package][svelte-jsx] that adds support
for the JSX automatic runtime to Svelte.

See also [¶ esbuild][esbuild], [¶ Rollup][rollup], and [¶ webpack][webpack],
which you might be using, for more info.

#### Vue

<details>
  <summary>Expand example</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'
  import babel from '@babel/core'

  const jsx = String(await compile('# hi', {jsx: true, /* otherOptions… */}))
  const js = (await babel.transformAsync(jsx, {plugins: ['@vue/babel-plugin-jsx']})).code
  ```
</details>

Vue 3 is supported when using their custom Babel JSX transformer
([`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next/tree/dev/packages/babel-plugin-jsx))
and configuring [`@mdx-js/mdx`][mdx-mdx], [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-react], or
[`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader] with `jsx: true`.
You can optionally install and configure [`@mdx-js/vue`][mdx-vue], which allows
for context based component passing.

See also [¶ Vite][vite] and [¶ Vue CLI][vue-cli], which you might be using,
for more info.

### JavaScript engines

#### Node.js

MDX files can be imported in Node by using
[`@mdx-js/node-loader`][mdx-node-loader] (*strongly recommended*) or
alternatively they can be `require`d with the legacy package
[`@mdx-js/register`][mdx-register].
See their readmes on how to configure them.
