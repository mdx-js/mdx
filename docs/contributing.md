## Support

[Read the Support guidelines on the MDX website][support].

## Contributions

There’s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.

### Financial support

It’s possible to support us financially by becoming a backer or sponsor of
unified through [Open Collective][collective].
With this support, we can pay for project leadership, finance non-coding work,
or to do fun things for the community like getting stickers for contributors.
You’ll be helping unified’s maintainers manage and improve existing projects,
and additionally support our work to develop new and exciting projects, such
as [micromark][].

### Improve documentation

As a user of this project you’re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
Anything!

All MDX docs live in the `/docs` directory.
You can edit the files directly on GitHub or in your favorite text editor.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, aren’t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
Help make them easier to resolve.

### Give feedback on issues and pull requests

We’re always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.  It’s often good to first create an issue
to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to
prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

## Running the tests

1.  `yarn`
2.  `yarn bootstrap`
3.  `yarn test`

Tests for an individual package can be run as a yarn workspace:
`yarn workspace remark-mdx test`.  To see what packages ar available to test
you can list out all workspaces with `yarn workspaces info`.

## Running the docs site

1.  `yarn`
2.  `yarn bootstrap`
3.  `yarn docs`

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.  Use chat for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure you’re using the latest version of our packages
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation
*   Don’t include unrelated changes
*   Test before submitting code by running `yarn test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    it’s your job to convince us

## Project structure

MDX is a monorepo that uses [lerna][].

*   All packages are found in `./packages`
*   All documentation is found in `./docs` and can be viewed with `yarn docs -- -o`
*   There’s an `./examples` directory where examples for different tools and
    frameworks

## Releases

In order to release a new version you can follow these steps:

*   Draft a release for the next version (vX.X.X)
*   Release a prerelease
    *   `yarn lerna publish`
    *   Select prepatch/preminor/premajor
    *   Sanity check in a project or two with the prerelease
*   `yarn lerna publish`
*   Publish release on GitHub

## Troubleshooting

If you’re having issues installing locally you might need to run
`yarn lerna exec yarn install` instead of `yarn bootstrap`
([issue][lerna-install]).
