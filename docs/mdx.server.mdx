# What is MDX?

This article explains what MDX is.
It shows how markdown, JSX, JavaScript expressions, and `import` and
`export` statements in ESM can be used inside MDX.
See [§ Getting started][start] for details on how to integrate MDX into your project.

## MDX prerequisites

To write and enjoy MDX, you should be familiar with both markdown
(see this [cheat sheet and tutorial][commonmark-help] for help) and
JavaScript (specifically [JSX][jsx-spec]).

## MDX: Markdown for the component era

MDX is exciting because it allows you to write JSX in your markdown content.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
🚀

Practically, MDX can be explained as a format that combines markdown with
JSX. The result looks as follows:

```mdx
# Hello, world!

<div className="note">
  > Some notable things in a block quote!
</div>
```

The heading and block quote are markdown, while those *HTML-like things* are JSX.
Markdown often feels more natural to type than HTML or JSX for common things
like emphasis or headings.
JSX is an extension to JavaScript that *looks* like HTML but makes it convenient
to use components.

This example uses `className` on the `<div>`.
That’s because it was written for React and React expects classes that way.
Other frameworks, such as Vue and Preact, expect classes to be defined
differently, so note that there are some differences in how JSX has to be
authored depending on what tools it’s used with.

A few other things from JavaScript are supported in MDX as well: expressions in
braces (`{1 + 1}`) and ESM (`import` and `export`).

## MDX syntax

<Note type="info">
  **Note**:
  You don’t have to use this syntax with `@mdx-js/*` packages.
  Or use it always.
  If you’re using a bundler integration you can change between MDX and markdown
  through the file extension (`.mdx` vs. `.md`).
  Alternatively, [`options.format`][format] can be used.
</Note>

The MDX syntax is a mix between markdown and JSX.
This gives us something along the lines of literate programming.
It also gives us an odd mix of two languages: markdown is whitespace sensitive
and forgiving (what you type may not exactly work but it won’t crash) whereas
JavaScript is whitespace **insensitive** and **does** crash on typos.
Weirdly enough we quite like how they combine!

### Markdown

Markdown often feels more natural to type than HTML or JSX for the common things
(like emphasis and headings).
It typically looks more like what’s intended and it is typically terser.
Instead of the following HTML:

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A blockquote with <em>some</em> emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
```

You can write the equivalent in markdown (or MDX) like so:

```md
> A blockquote with *some* emphasis.
```

Markdown is good for **content**.
MDX supports standard markdown syntax:

````md
# Heading (rank 1)
## Heading 2
### 3
#### 4
##### 5
###### 6

> Block quote

* Unordered
* List

1. Ordered
2. List

A paragraph, introducing a thematic break:

---

```js
some.code()
```

a [link](https://example.com), an ![image](./image.png), some *emphasis*,
something **strong**, and finally a little `code()`.
````

MDX supports standard markdown by default ([CommonMark][]).
Nonstandard markdown features (such as GFM, frontmatter, math, syntax
highlighting) can be enabled with plugins (see
[¶ Using plugins][using-plugins]).

Some markdown features don’t work in MDX:

*   Indented code does not work in MDX:
    ```md
        console.log(1) // this is a paragraph in MDX!
    ```
    The reason for that is so you can nicely indent your components:
    ```html language="mdx"
    <main>
      <article>
        # Hello!
      </article>
    </main>
    ```
*   Autolinks do not work in MDX.
    The reason is that they can be indistinguishable from JSX (such as
    `<svg:rect>`) and we prefer being unambiguous.
    If you want links, use full links:
    `[descriptive text](https://and-the-link-here.com)`
*   HTML doesn’t work in MDX as it’s replaced by JSX
*   Unescaped left angle bracket / less than (`<`) and left curly brace (`{`)
    have to be escaped: `\<` or `\{` (or use expressions: `{'<'}`, `{'{'}`)

More on how MDX differs from markdown is
[documented here](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#72-deviations-from-markdown).

### JSX

[JSX][] is an extension to JavaScript that *looks* like HTML but makes it
convenient to use components (reusable things).
JSX is typically combined with a frontend framework like React, Preact, or Vue.
These frameworks add support for components, which let you change repeating
things like the following markup:

```html
<h2>Hello, Venus!</h2>
<h2>Hello, Mars!</h2>
```

…to JSX (or MDX) like this:

```html language="mdx"
<Welcome name="Venus" />
<Welcome name="Mars" />
```

JSX is good for **components**.
It makes repeating things more clear and allows for separation of concerns.
MDX supports JSX syntax.
The following looks a lot like normal HTML:

```html language="mdx"
<h1>Heading!</h1>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a lovely language.

<section>
  And here is *markdown* in **JSX**!
</section>
```

But as previously mentioned you can use components too.
Note that components must be defined.
You can import them, define them locally, or pass them in later (see
[§ Using MDX][use]):

```html language="mdx"
<MyComponent id="123" />

You can also use objects with components, such as the `thisOne` component on
the `myComponents` object: <myComponents.thisOne />

<Component
  open
  x={1}
  label={'this is a string, *not* markdown!'}
  icon={<Icon />}
/>
```

There are a few edge cases
[where MDX differs from JSX](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#73-deviations-from-jsx).

### Expressions

MDX also supports JavaScript expressions inside curly braces:

```jsx language="mdx"
Two 🍰 is: {Math.PI * 2}
```

Expressions can contain whole JavaScript programs as long as that they’re
(wrapped in) an expression that evaluates to something that can be rendered.
You can use an [IIFE][] like so:

```jsx language="mdx"
{(function () {
  const guess = Math.random()

  if (guess > 0.66) {
    return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
  }

  if (guess > 0.33) {
    return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
  }

  return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}
```

Expressions can be empty or contain just a comment:

```mdx
{/* A comment! */}
```

### ESM

MDX supports `import` and `export` statements from JavaScript as well.
These ESM features can be used to define things from within MDX:

```jsx language="mdx"
import {External} from './some/place.js'

export const Local = props => <span style={{color: 'red'}} {...props} />

An <External>external</External> component and a <Local>local one</Local>.
```

ESM can also be used for non-components (data):

```jsx language="mdx"
import {Chart} from './chart.js'
import population from './population.js'
export const pi = 3.14

<Chart data={population} label={'Something with ' + pi} />
```
