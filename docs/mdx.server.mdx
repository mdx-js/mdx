# What is MDX?

## Markdown for the component era

MDX is an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown
documents.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
üöÄ

## Try it

<Editor children={`Hello, *world*!

Below is an example of JSX embedded in Markdown.

<div style={{padding: '20px', backgroundColor: 'tomato', color: 'black' }}>
**Try and change the background color!**
</div>`}/>

## In short

‚ù§Ô∏è **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
JSX-based projects.

üíª **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.

üîß **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
element (`{h1: MyHeading}`).

üìö **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of Markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.

üî• **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.

## Why?

Before MDX, some of the benefits of writing Markdown were lost when integrating
with JSX.
Implementations were often template string-based which required lots of escaping
and cumbersome syntax.

MDX seeks to make writing with Markdown *and* JSX simpler while being more
expressive.
Writing is fun again when you combine components, that can even be dynamic or
load data, with the simplicity of Markdown for long-form content.

It combines the readability of Markdown with the expressivity of JSX. The best of both worlds. üåê"
