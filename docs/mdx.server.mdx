# What is MDX?

This article explains what the MDX format is.
See [¬ß Getting started][start] for how to integrate MDX into your project.

## Prerequisites

It‚Äôs important to know markdown
([see this cheatsheet and tutorial][commonmark-help] for help) and have
experience with JavaScript (specifically [JSX][jsx-spec]) to write (and enjoy
writing) MDX.

## Markdown for the component era

MDX is exciting because it‚Äôs an authorable format that lets you seamlessly write
JSX in your Markdown documents.
You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them
within your content.
This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.
üöÄ

More practically MDX can be explained as a format that combines markdown with
JSX and looks as follows:

```mdx
# Hello, world!

<div className="note">
  > Some notable things in a block quote!
</div>
```

The heading and the block quote are markdown and those XML-like things are JSX
instead of HTML.
Markdown often feels more natural to type than HTML (or JSX) for the common
things (like emphasis, headings).
JSX is an extension to JavaScript that *looks* like HTML but makes it convenient
to use components (reusable things).

This example uses `className` on the `<div>`.
That‚Äôs because this example was written with React in mind which expects classes
to be added as such.
Other frameworks, such as Vue and Preact, expect classes to be defined
differently, so note that there are some differences in how JSX has to be
authored depending on what tools it‚Äôs used with.

A few other things from JavaScript are supported in MDX as well: expressions in
braces (`{1 + 1}`) and ESM (`import` and `export`).

## MDX syntax

<Note type="info">
  **Note**:
  You don‚Äôt have to use this syntax with `@mdx-js/*` packages.
  Or use it always.
  With [`options.format`][format], you can opt-in gradually or not at all.
</Note>

The MDX syntax is a mix between markdown and JS(X).
This gives us something along the lines of [literate programming][lit].
It also gives us an odd mix of two languages: markdown is whitespace sensitive
and forgiving (what you type may not ‚Äúwork‚Äù but it won‚Äôt crash) whereas
JavaScript is whitespace **insensitive** and **does** crash on typos.
Weirdly enough we found they combine pretty well!
See [this description in
`micromark/mdx-state-machine`](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#71-syntax)
for a formal description of the MDX syntax.
Some common gotchas with writing MDX are
[documented here in `micromark/mdx-state-machine`
](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#74-common-mdx-gotchas).

### Markdown

Traditionally, markdown is used to generate HTML.
Many developers like writing markup in markdown as it often looks more like
what‚Äôs intended and it is typically terser.
Instead of the following HTML:

```html
<blockquote>
  <p>A blockquote with <em>some</em> emphasis.</p>
</blockquote>
```

You can write the equivalent in markdown (or MDX) like so:

```md
> A blockquote with *some* emphasis.
```

Markdown is good for **content**.
MDX supports standard markdown syntax ([CommonMark][]):

````md
# Heading (rank 1)
## Heading 2
### 3
#### 4
##### 5
###### 6

> Block quote

* Unordered
* List

1. Ordered
2. List

A paragraph, introducing a thematic break:

---

```js
some.code()
```

a [link](https://example.com), an ![image](./image.png), some *emphasis*,
something **strong**, and finally a little `code()`.
````

MDX supports standard markdown only (CommonMark).
Nonstandard markdown features (such as GFM, frontmatter, footnotes, math, syntax
highlighting) can be enabled by [configuring plugins][using-plugins].

Certain standard markdown features don‚Äôt work in MDX:

*   Indented code does not work in MDX:
    ```md
        console.log(1) // this is a paragraph in MDX!
    ```
    The reason for that is so you can nicely indent your components:
    ```mdx
    <main>
      <article>
        # Hello!
      </article>
    </main>
    ```
*   Autolinks do not work in MDX.
    The reason is that they sometimes (such as `<svg:rect>` and
    `<admin@example.com>`) look *a lot* like JSX components, and we prefer
    being unambiguous.
    If you want links, use full links:
    `[descriptive text](https://and-the-link-here.com)`
*   HTML doesn‚Äôt work in MDX as it‚Äôs replaced by JSX
*   Unescaped left angle bracket / less than (`<`) and left curly brace (`{`)
    have to be escaped: `\<` or `\{`

More on how MDX differs from markdown is
[documented here](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#72-deviations-from-markdown).

### JSX

Recently, more and more developers have started using [JSX][] to generate HTML
markup.
JSX is typically combined with a frontend framework like React or Vue.
These frameworks add support for components, which let you change repeating
things like the following markup:

```html
<h2>Hello, Venus!</h2>
<h2>Hello, Mars!</h2>
```

‚Ä¶to JSX (or MDX) like this:

```jsx language="mdx"
<Welcome name="Venus" />
<Welcome name="Mars" />
```

JSX is good for **components**.
It makes repeating things more clear and allows for separation of concerns.
MDX fully supports [JSX syntax][jsx].
Here‚Äôs some JSX looks a lot like HTML:

```jsx language="mdx"
<h1>Heading!</h1>

<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a lovely language.

<section>
  And here is *markdown* in **JSX**!
</section>
```

You can also use components in MDX.
Note that you must either define them locally or pass them in later
(see [¬ß Using MDX][use]):

```jsx language="mdx"
<MyComponent id="123" />

Or access the `thisOne` component on the `myComponents` object: <myComponents.thisOne />

<Component
  open
  x={1}
  label={'this is a string, *not* markdown!'}
  icon={<Icon />}
/>
```

There are a few edge cases
[where MDX differs from JSX](https://github.com/micromark/mdx-state-machine#73-deviations-from-jsx).

### ESM

MDX supports `import` and `export` statements from JavaScript as well.
These ESM features can be used to define things from within MDX:

```jsx language="mdx"
import {External} from './some/place.js'

export const Local = props => <span style={{color: 'red'}} {...props} />

An <External>external</External> component and a <Local>local one</Local>.
```

ESM can also be used for non-components (data):

```jsx language="mdx"
import {Chart} from './chart.js'
import population from './population.js'
export const pi = 3.14

<Chart data={population} label={'Something with ' + pi} />
```

### Expressions

MDX also supports JavaScript expressions inside curly braces:

```jsx language="mdx"
export const pi = 3.14

Two üç∞ is: {pi * 2}
```

Expressions can contain whole JavaScript programs as long as they‚Äôre (wrapped
in) an expression that evaluates to something that can be rendered.
You can use an [IIFE][] like so:

```jsx language="mdx"
{(function () {
  const guess = Math.random()

  if (guess > 0.66) {
    return <span style={{color: 'tomato'}}>Look at us.</span>
  }

  if (guess > 0.33) {
    return <span style={{color: 'violet'}}>Who would have guessed?!</span>
  }

  return <span style={{color: 'goldenrod'}}>Not me.</span>
})()}
```

Expressions can be empty or contain just a comment:

```mdx
{/* A comment! */}
```
