# Extending MDX

This article explains how to extend MDX content—specifically, how to *transform*
content with plugins.
See [§ Getting started][start] for how to integrate MDX into your project.

## Contents

*   [Components & plugins](#components--plugins)
    *   [List of components](#list-of-components)
    *   [List of plugins](#list-of-plugins)
*   [Using plugins](#using-plugins)
*   [Creating plugins](#creating-plugins)

## Components & plugins

`@mdx-js/mdx`—our core compiler that turns MDX into JavaScript—has several
extension points:

*   Components can be defined internally or passed at runtime
    (see [§ Using MDX][use])
*   Plugins can hook into several stages of compilation (see [remark
    plugins][remark-plugins], [rehype plugins][rehype-plugins], and the new
    recma plugins)

Most of the time, these components and plugins are not coupled to MDX.
For example, if you’re using React with MDX, then you can use
[`<ReactConfetti />`][react-confetti].
A different example is that [`remark-gfm`][remark-gfm] can be passed at compile
time in [`options.remarkPlugins`](/packages/mdx/#optionsremarkplugins), to turn
on GFM features in MDX.
We think it’s important that the MDX language is not coupled to a single
framework and that it isn’t its own island but instead works together with
other projects.

Sometimes though, we need specific components or specific plugins to work with
MDX.
Some of these are listed here:

### List of components

*   [`PaulieScanlon/mdx-embed`](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/mdx-embed)
    — React components for embedding 3rd party content, integrates w/
    MDX provider
*   [`system-ui/theme-ui`](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui)
    — React components for building consistent apps, integrates w/ MDX provider

### List of plugins

See also the [list of remark plugins][remark-plugins] and
[list of rehype plugins][rehype-plugins].

*   [`remcohaszing/rehype-mdx-title`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/rehype-mdx-title)
    — expose the page title as a string
*   [`remcohaszing/remark-mdx-code-meta`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-code-meta)
    — interpret the code `meta` field as JSX props
*   [`remcohaszing/remark-mdx-images`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-images)
    — change image sources to JavaScript imports
*   [`remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter`](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter)
    — change frontmatter (YAML) metadata to exports

## Using plugins

Where to pass plugins depends on their name: remark plugins go in
[`options.remarkPlugins`](/packages/mdx/#optionsremarkplugins), rehype plugins
in [`rehypePlugins`](/packages/mdx/#optionsrehypeplugins).
Those fields expect lists of plugins and/or of `[plugin, options]`:

```js
import {compile} from '@mdx-js/mdx'
import rehypeKatex from 'rehype-katex' // Render math with KaTeX.
import remarkFrontmatter from 'remark-frontmatter' // YAML and such.
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm' // Tables, footnotes, strikethrough, tasklists, literal URLs.
import remarkMath from 'remark-math' // Support math like `$so$`.

const file = '# hi'

// One plugin:
await compile(file, {remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm]})

// A plugin with options:
await compile(file, {remarkPlugins: [[remarkFrontmatter, 'toml']]})

// Two plugins:
await compile(file, {remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm, remarkFrontmatter]})

// Two plugins, first w/ options:
await compile(file, {remarkPlugins: [[remarkGfm, {singleTilde: false}], remarkFrontmatter]})

// remark and rehype plugins:
await compile(file, {remarkPlugins: [remarkMath], rehypePlugins: [rehypeKatex]})

// remark and rehype plugins, last w/ options:
await compile(file, {
  remarkPlugins: [remarkMath],
  // A plugin with options:
  rehypePlugins: [[rehypeKatex, {throwOnError: true, strict: true}]]
})
```

## Creating plugins

Creating a plugin for MDX is mostly the same as creating a plugin for remark
or rehype.
There are several guides and recipes on that in [§ Learn on
`unifiedjs.com`][learn].

For the MDX specific parts of plugins, it’s recommended to read
[§ Architecture](/packages/mdx/#architecture) to learn how `@mdx-js/mdx` works.

For info on new node types supported in MDX, see [¶ Syntax tree in
`remark-mdx`](/packages/remark-mdx/#syntax-tree) and use our interactive
[Playground](/playground/).
