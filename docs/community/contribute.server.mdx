# Contribute

This article explains how to contribute to MDX.
Please read through the following guidelines.

{/* more */}

<Note type="important">
  **Important**: before participating in our community, please read our
  [code of conduct][coc].
  By interacting with this repository, organization, or community you agree to
  abide by its terms.
</Note>

## Contributions

Thereâ€™s several ways to contribute, not just by writing code.
If you have questions, see [Â§ Support][support].
If you can provide financial support, see [Â§ Sponsor][sponsor].

### Improve docs

As a user youâ€™re perfect for helping us improve our docs.
Typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, new examples, etcetera.
All MDX docs live in `docs/`.

### Improve issues

Some issues lack information, arenâ€™t reproducible, or are just incorrect.
You can help by trying to make them easier to resolve.
Existing issues might benefit from your unique experience or opinions.

### Write code

Code contributions are very welcome.
Itâ€™s probably a good idea to first post a question or open an issue to report a
bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request.

## Submitting an issue

*   The issue tracker is for issues.
    Use discussions for support
*   Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new
    issue
*   Ensure youâ€™re using the latest version of our packages
*   Use a clear and descriptive title
*   Include as much information as possible: steps to reproduce the issue,
    error message, version, operating system, etcetera
*   The more time you put into an issue, the better we will be able to help you
*   The best issue report is a [failing test][unit-test] proving it

## Submitting a pull request

*   See [Â¶ Project][project] below for info on how the project is structured,
    how to test, and how to build the site
*   Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent
    you from doing unnecessary work
*   For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the
    community for feedback as soon as possible
*   New features should be accompanied by tests and documentation
*   Donâ€™t include unrelated changes
*   Test before submitting code by running `npm test`
*   Write a convincing description of why we should land your pull request:
    itâ€™s your job to convince us

## Project

### Structure

MDX is a monorepo.
All packages are in `packages/`.
Documentation is in `docs/`.

### Tests

To run the tests, first do `npm install`, then do `npm test`.
This ensures everything is okay, from code style to unit tests to types.

### Site

To build the site, first do `npm install`, then do `npm run docs`.
This produces the website in `public/`.

<Note type="important">
  **Important**: the site uses several experimental packages.
  They require Node.js 14, and donâ€™t work in earlier or later
  versions.
  To build the site, please use Node.js 14 (with `nvm`: `nvm use 14`).
</Note>

### Release

To release a new version, do:

1.  update `version`s of packages with a patch, minor, or major (make sure to
    update dependency ranges on monorepo packages when needed):
    ```sh
    npm version minor --workspaces --no-git-tag-version
    ```
2.  commit and tag using the version (without `v`) as the message:
    ```sh
    git commit --all --message 1.2.3 && git tag 1.2.3 && git push && git push --tags
    ```
3.  release to the npm registry:
    ```sh
    npm publish --workspaces
    ```
4.  add a changelog entry for the release on GitHub:
    ```sh
    open https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/releases
    ```
