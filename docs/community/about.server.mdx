# About

This article explains in short how MDX came to be and why it exists.
It also gives thanks to the people who’ve helped make it and inspired it.

## What is MDX?

MDX is the combination of markdown with JSX.
See [§ What is MDX?][what] for more info.

## Why MDX?

Markdown does not have a syntax for custom components.
MDX solves this.

There are many languages objectively better than markdown, however, markdown is
great because:

*   It looks like what it means and is relatively easy to read
*   Although images are [confusing][], most stuff is relatively simple to write
*   It’s loose and ambiguous: it may not work but you won’t get an error (great
    for someone posting a comment to a forum if they forgot an asterisk)

Markdown *does* have a way to extend it, HTML, but that has drawbacks:

*   HTML in Markdown is naïve, how it’s parsed sometimes doesn’t make sense
*   HTML is unsafe by default, so it’s sometimes (partially) unsupported
*   HTML and Markdown don’t mix well, resulting in confusing rules such as
    blank lines or `markdown="1"` attributes
*   HTML is coupled with browsers, Markdown is useful for other things too

The frontend world has an alternative to HTML: JSX.
JSX is great, amongst other things, because:

*   It has a relatively familiar syntax (like XML)
*   It’s agnostic to semantics and intended for compilers (can have any
    domain-specific meaning)
*   It’s strict and unambiguous (great if an author forgot a slash somewhere, as
    they’ll get an error early, instead of a book going to print with broken
    stuff in it)

## Who governs MDX?

The project is governed by the
[unified collective][governance].

## Who created MDX?

The idea of combining [markdown][commonmark], [JavaScript][], and [JSX][] was a
collaborative effort by
[Guillermo Rauch][mdx-rauchg] (**[@rauchg][rauchg]**),
[James K. Nelson][mdx-jamesknelson] (**[@jamesknelson][jamesknelson]**),
[John Otander][mdx-johno] (**[@johno][johno]**),
Tim Neutkens (**[@timneutkens][timneutkens]**),
Brent Jackson (**[@jxnblk][jxnblk]**),
Jessica Stokes (**[@ticky][ticky]**), and more.

## Who designed the logo?

[Logo designs][design] were created by [Evil Rabbit][] of [Vercel][] and are
also available on [GitHub][design].

The [markdown][] and [JSX][] languages inspired MDX.
Markdown was [created by John Gruber][markdown] (**[@gruber][gruber]**).
[CommonMark][] by John McFarlane et al. (**[@jgm][jgm]**) is a popular variant.
JSX was [created by Sebastian Markbåge et al.][jsx]
(**[@sebmarkbage][sebmarkbage]**) at
Facebook, Inc.

The `@mdx-js/*` projects currently make heavy use of [unified][] (specifically
[micromark][], [remark][] and [rehype][]) and [Acorn][].
unified, remark, rehype, and related tools were created by Titus Wormer
(**[@wooorm][wooorm]**) et al.
Acorn by Marijn Haverbeke (**[@marijnh][marijnh]**) et al.
