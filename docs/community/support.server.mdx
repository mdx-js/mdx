Help us help you!
Spend time framing a question and add support links or resources.
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.
Here are some tips:

*   Read through [§ Getting started](/getting-started)
*   Learn about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduck]
*   Avoid falling for the [XY problem][xy]
*   Search to see if a similar question has been asked
*   Try to define what you need help with:
    *   Is there something in particular you want to do?
    *   What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try
        and fix it?
    *   Is there a concept you’re not understanding?
*   If possible, provide sample code, a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io),
    or a video
*   The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
