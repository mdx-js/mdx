# Migrating from v2 to v3

A couple small changes this time around.
For most folks, updating Node.js and plugins is all that’s needed!

## Update Node.js

If you’re still on old Node, it’s time to update.
Use at least Node 16.

## Update plugins

If you use rehype and remark plugins: update.

Most of them remain working between versions.
Particularly if you use TypeScript, there was a breaking internal change in the
types, which is now supported here.
There were also some small internal changes in how the parser works, which
affect `remark-gfm` and `remark-math`.

## Pass `baseUrl` to `evaluate`, `run`

If you use `evaluate` or `run` (or `outputFormat: 'function-body'`), you should
pass the `baseUrl` option.
Likely set to `import.meta.url`.

If MDX content uses `export` statements, `import` expressions/statements,
or `import.meta.url`, we compile to code that works, but it needs to know
where the code runs: you need to pass where you are.

You will get a runtime error if these features are used in MDX without
`baseUrl`.

If you passed the `useDynamicImport` option before, remove it, the behavior
is now the default.

If you use `react/jsx-runtime`, you might get a TypeScript error (such as
`Property 'Fragment' is missing in type`), because it is typed incorrectly.
To remediate this, do:

```tsx
import {type Fragment, type Jsx, run} from '@mdx-js/mdx'
import * as runtime_ from 'react/jsx-runtime'

// @ts-expect-error: the automatic react runtime is untyped.
const runtime: {Fragment: Fragment; jsx: Jsx; jsxs: Jsx} = runtime_

const result = await run('# hi', {...runtime, baseUrl: import.meta.url})
```

## Use the automatic JSX runtime

If you use the classic runtime, switch to the automatic runtime.
Classic is still supported but you will now see a warning if you use the
classic JSX runtime.

The classic runtime can still be nice in other places, but it causes potential
problems in MDX.
If you specify `jsxRuntime: 'classic'` (and `pragma`, `pragmaFrag`,
`pragmaImportSource`), consider switching to `automatic`.
All major frameworks support the automatic runtime.
Support for the classic runtime will likely be removed next major.

## Replace `MDXContext`, `withMDXComponents` with `useMDXComponents`

If you use the deprecated symbols `MDXContext` and `withMDXComponents`, use
`useMDXComponents` instead.

Reminder: you probably don’t need the context based `@mdx-js/react` or
`@mdx-js/preact` packages.

## Replace `@mdx-js/register` with `@mdx-js/node-loader`

If you use the deprecated package `@mdx-js/register`, use `@mdx-js/node-loader` instead.
