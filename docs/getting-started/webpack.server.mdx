# Webpack

MDX provides a built in webpack loader you need to install and configure
for webpack projects.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @mdx-js/loader
```

## Configuration

The loader needs to be used in tandem with the [babel-loader][].
Most projects will typically already include this if you are using JSX syntax.

For webpack projects you can define the following `webpack.config.js` extension
handler for `.md` and `.mdx` files:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    // ...

    rules: [
      // ...

      {
        test: /\.mdx?$/,
        use: ['babel-loader', '@mdx-js/loader']
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If you only want the loader for `.mdx` files you can change the regex to
`/\.mdx$/`.

The transpiled output for MDX requires [babel][] to be run.
This is typically by adding in the babel-loader to run *after* the MDX loader.
Webpack starts from the end of the loaders array and works backward, so it is
important to follow the ordering above.

## Using plugins

If you’d like to configure [plugins](/advanced/plugins) you can do that by
passing them as options:

```js
const images = require('remark-images')
const emoji = require('remark-emoji')
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.mdx?$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'babel-loader'
          },
          {
            loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
            options: {
              remarkPlugins: [images, emoji]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Running MDX in the browser

If you’re running MDX in the browser you will need to configure webpack to
ignore the `fs` module:

```js
module.exports = {
  node: {
    fs: 'empty'
  }
}
```

[See the webpack
docs](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/#other-node-core-libraries)

## Babel configuration

You will also need to configure [babel][] to support the language features that
MDX uses.
One way you can achieve that is using the following `.babelrc` at your project
root.

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/env", "@babel/react"]
}
```

And installing the dependencies:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react
```
