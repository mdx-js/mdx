# Zero

[Zero](https://zeroserver.io) is a no-config web framework for React, MDX, Nodejs, and Vue. It has built in support for MDX. To get started, install Zero (globally or locally in your project).

## Installation

```shell
npm install -g zero
```

## Writing MDX files

Create a new directory for your project and add an `index.mdx` file  with the following markdown:

```markdown
# My first MDX Page

some awesome content
```

Now, `cd` into your project directory and run `zero`.

Zero has some additional features for MDX, you can [read them here](https://github.com/remoteinterview/zero/tree/master/docs/mdx).
