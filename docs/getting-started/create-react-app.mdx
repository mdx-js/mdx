# Create React App

First, create a new app with [CRA][] and change directory to enter it:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

Second, we need to configure some build tools.
Install [`@mdx-js/loader`][loader] and [`babel-loader`][babel-loader] as dev
dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/loader babel-loader --dev
```

Also make sure that JSX in MDX is handled by Babel by creating a `.babelrc` JSON
file in the project root of `my-app`:

```json
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-react"]
}
```

Third, we can add our MDX content.
Create an MDX file `Content.mdx` in the `src/` folder:

```mdx
export const Box = () => (
  <div style={{padding: 20, backgroundColor: 'tomato'}} />
)

# Hello, world!

This is **markdown** with <span style={{color: "red"}}>JSX</span>: MDX!

<Box />
```

And to use that MDX content in the app, replace the contents of `App.js` in the
`src/` folder with:

```js
/* eslint-disable import/no-webpack-loader-syntax */
import Content from '!babel-loader!@mdx-js/loader!./Content.mdx'

function App() {
  return <Content />
}

export default App
```

We’re almost done!
To start the development server, run:

```sh
yarn start
```

**…but you will probably get this error**:

```txt
$ react-scripts start

There might be a problem with the project dependency tree.
It is likely not a bug in Create React App, but something you need to fix locally.

The react-scripts package provided by Create React App requires a dependency:

  "babel-loader": "$VERSION"
…
```

CRA expects a certain `babel-loader` version but MDX also needs one.
To fix the error, make sure the two `babel-loader` versions match, by running
the following:

```sh
yarn add babel-loader@$VERSION --dev
```

(where `$VERSION` is the version number printed in the error message, such as
`8.1.0`).

Then, running `yarn start` again should do the trick! ✨
