# Getting started

This article explains how to integrate MDX into your project.
If you’re new to MDX we recommend that you start with [§ What is MDX][what].
See [§ Using MDX][use] when you’re ready to use MDX.

## Contents

*   [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
*   [Bundler](#bundler)
*   [JSX](#jsx)
*   [Third-party integrations](#third-party-integrations)

## Prerequisites

MDX relies on JSX, so it’s required that your project supports JSX as well.
Any JSX runtime (React, Preact, Vue, Ink, etc.) will do.
Please make sure that JSX works for your project.

All `@mdx-js/*` packages are written in modern JavaScript.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 12.20, 14.14, 16.0, or later is required
to use them.

## Bundler

MDX is a language that’s compiled to JavaScript.
The easiest way to get started is to use an integration for your bundler if you
have one:

*   If you’re using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io),
    please install and configure [`@mdx-js/esbuild`](/packages/esbuild/)
*   If you’re using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org)
    (or [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev),
    or [WMR](https://wmr.dev), which use it),
    please install and configure [`@mdx-js/rollup`](/packages/rollup/)
*   If you’re using [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
    (or [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
    [Razzle](https://razzlejs.org),
    [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static), or
    [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which use it),
    please install and configure [`@mdx-js/loader`](/packages/loader/)

You can also use MDX if you’re not using a bundler:

*   If you want to import MDX files in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), you can
    install and configure the experimental package
    [`@mdx-js/node-loader`](/packages/node-loader/) (**recommended**) or
    alternatively require them with the legacy package
    [`@mdx-js/register`](/packages/register/)
*   Otherwise, you can install and use the core compiler
    [`@mdx-js/mdx`](/packages/mdx/) to manually compile MDX files

Using something else?
Perhaps there’s something for you in [§ Third-party integrations][third].

## JSX

Now you’ve set up `@mdx-js/mdx` or an integration, it’s time to configure your
JSX runtime.

*   If you’re using [React](https://reactjs.org),
    you don’t need to do anything!
    Optionally you can install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`](/packages/react/)
*   If you’re using [Preact](https://preactjs.com),
    set `options.jsxImportSource` to `'preact'`.
    Optionally you can install and configure
    [`@mdx-js/preact`](/packages/preact/)
*   If you’re using [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org),
    set `options.jsx` to `false`.
    You then have to use Babel alongside your MDX integration (possible with
    webpack and Rollup but not esbuild)
    and configure it to use
    [`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next/tree/dev/packages/babel-plugin-jsx).
    Optionally you can also install and configure
    [`@mdx-js/vue`](/packages/vue/)
*   If you’re using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh),
    set `options.jsxImportSource` to `'@emotion/react'`
*   If you’re using [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com),
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`](/packages/react/).
    Then wrap your MDX content in a `<ThemeProvider />`

## Third-party integrations

There are also certain community driven integrations.
As we’ve just hit a major milestone with v2, they will likely be out of date
with our docs here.
Some of those integrations are:

*   [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/)
    — Use MDX with Gatsby
*   [`@parcel/transformer-mdx`](https://v2.parceljs.org/languages/mdx/)
    — Use MDX with Parcel
*   [`mdx-bundler`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)
    — Bundle and evaluate MDX
*   [`mdsvex`](https://github.com/pngwn/mdsvex)
    — A markdown preprocessor for Svelte (not MDX, but somewhat similar)
