# Getting started

This article explains how to integrate MDX into your project.
It shows how to use MDX with your bundler and JSX runtime of choice.
It explains the markdown, JSX, JavaScript expressions, and ESM import/exports
that can be used.
If you’re new to MDX we recommend that you start with [§ What is MDX][what].
See [§ Using MDX][use] when you’re all set up and ready to use MDX.

    *   [JavaScript engines](#javascript-engines)

## Prerequisites

MDX relies on JSX, so it’s required that your project supports JSX as well.
Any JSX runtime (React, Preact, Vue, etc.) will do.
Note that we do compile JSX to JS already so you don’t have to set that up.

All `@mdx-js/*` packages are written in modern JavaScript.
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 12.20, 14.14, 16.0, or later is required
to use them.
They’re also [ESM only][esm], so they have to be `import`ed instead of
`require`d.

## Quick start

### Bundler

MDX is a language that’s compiled to JavaScript.
(We also compile regular markdown to JavaScript.)
The easiest way to get started is to use an integration for your bundler if you
have one:

*   If you’re using **esbuild**,
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/esbuild`][mdx-esbuild]
*   If you’re using **Rollup**
    (or Vite or WMR, which use it),
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-rollup]
*   If you’re using **webpack**
    (or Create React App (CRA), Next.js, or Vue CLI, which use it),
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/loader`][mdx-loader]

You can also use MDX if you’re not using a bundler:

*   If you want to import MDX files in **Node.js**, you can
    install and configure the experimental package
    [`@mdx-js/node-loader`][mdx-node-loader]
*   Otherwise, you can install and use the core compiler
    [`@mdx-js/mdx`][mdx-mdx] to manually compile MDX files
*   Finally, it’s also possible to evaluate (compile *and run*) MDX anywhere,
    with [`evaluate` from `@mdx-js/mdx`][evaluate].

See also the specific sections for each of the aforementioned tools for more
info on getting started with them:
[¶ Create React App (CRA)][cra], [¶ esbuild][esbuild],
[¶ Next.js][next], [¶ Node.js][node],
[¶ Rollup][rollup], [¶ Vite][vite], [¶ Vue CLI][vue-cli],
[¶ WMR][wmr], [¶ webpack][webpack].

There are also certain community driven integrations.
As we’ve just hit a major milestone with v2, they might be out of date with our
docs here though.
See:
[¶ Gatsby][gatsby],
[¶ Parcel][parcel],
[¶ Razzle][razzle],
[¶ React Static][react-static], and
[¶ Snowpack][snowpack].

### JSX

Now you’ve set up an integration or `@mdx-js/mdx` itself, it’s time to configure
your JSX runtime.

*   If you’re using **React**,
    you don’t need to do anything!
    Optionally you can install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react]
*   If you’re using **Preact**,
    set [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] to `'preact'`.
    Optionally you can install and configure
    [`@mdx-js/preact`][mdx-preact]
*   If you’re using **Vue 3**,
    set [`options.jsx`][options-jsx] to `true`.
    You then have to use Babel alongside your MDX integration (possible with
    webpack and Rollup but not esbuild)
    and configure it to use
    [`@vue/babel-plugin-jsx`](https://github.com/vuejs/jsx-next/tree/dev/packages/babel-plugin-jsx).
    Optionally you can also install and configure
    [`@mdx-js/vue`][mdx-vue]
*   If you’re using **Emotion**,
    set [`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource] to
    `'@emotion/react'`
*   If you’re using **Theme UI**,
    install and configure [`@mdx-js/react`][mdx-react].
    Then wrap your MDX content in a `<ThemeProvider />`

Other JSX runtimes are also supported by setting
[`options.jsxImportSource`][options-jsximportsource].
See also the different options there on how to use the classic JSX runtime
and how to define a `pragma` and `pragmaFrag` for it.

See also the specific sections for each of the aforementioned tools for more
info on getting started with them:
[¶ Emotion][emotion],
[¶ Preact][preact],
[¶ React][react],
[¶ Theme UI][themeui], or
[¶ Vue][vue].

### Editor

Once everything is set up in your project, you can enhance the experience by
adding support for MDX in your editor:

*   With **VS Code**,
    try [`silvenon/vscode-mdx`](https://github.com/silvenon/vscode-mdx)
    and/or [`xyc/vscode-mdx-preview`](https://github.com/xyc/vscode-mdx-preview)
*   With **Vim**,
    try [`jxnblk/vim-mdx-js`](https://github.com/jxnblk/vim-mdx-js)
*   With **Sublime Text**,
    try [`jonsuh/mdx-sublime`](https://github.com/jonsuh/mdx-sublime)
*   With **JetBrains IntelliJ/WebStorm**,
    try [`valentinnodan/mdx-intellij-plugin`](https://github.com/valentinnodan/mdx-intellij-plugin)

<Note type="info">
  **Note**: we’re looking for help with atom, emacs, and others!
</Note>

### Types

All our APIs are fully typed with
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
To enable types for imported `.mdx`, `.md`, etcetera files, first make sure
the TypeScript `JSX` namespace is typed (such as by importing the `react`
types if you’re using that) and then install and use
[`@types/mdx`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/HEAD/types/mdx).

<details>
  <summary>Show example of types in JavaScript</summary>

  ```js path="example.js"
  /**
   * @typedef {import('react')}
   * @typedef {import('@types/mdx')}
   */

  import Post from './example.mdx' // `Post` is now typed.
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Show example of types in TypeScript</summary>

  ```ts path="example.ts"
  /// <reference types="react" />
  /// <reference types="@types/mdx" />

  import Post from './example.mdx' // `Post` is now typed.
  ```
</details>

### Security

Please note that MDX is a programming language.
If you trust your authors, that’s fine.
But be extremely careful with user content and don’t let random people from the
internet write MDX.
If you do, you might want to look into using `<iframe>`s with `sandbox`, but
security is hard, and that doesn’t seem to be 100%.
For Node, [vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2) sounds interesting.
But you should probably also sandbox the whole OS (Docker?), perform rate
limiting, and make sure processes can be killed when taking too long.

          .loader('@mdx-js/loader')
          .options({jsx: true, /* Other options… */})
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

See also [¶ webpack][webpack], which is used in Vue CLI, and see [¶ Vue][vue],
which you’re likely using, for more info.

#### WMR

[WMR](https://github.com/preactjs/wmr) supports Rollup plugins directly by
[adding them to `plugins`](https://wmr.dev/docs/plugins/) in `wmr.config.mjs`.

Install and configure the rollup plugin [`@mdx-js/rollup`][mdx-rollup].
[Configure your JSX runtime][jsx] depending on which one you use (react, preact,
vue, etc.)

<details>
  <summary>Show example</summary>

  ```js path="wmr.config.mjs"
  import {defineConfig} from 'wmr'
  import mdx from '@mdx-js/rollup'

  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      mdx({/* Options… */})
    ]
  })
  ```
</details>

See also [¶ Rollup][rollup], which is used in WMR, and see [¶ Preact][preact],
if you’re using that, for more info.

### Compilers

#### Babel

You should probably use webpack or Rollup instead of Babel directly as that
gives the neatest interface.
It is possible to use `@mdx-js/mdx` in Babel and it’s fast, because it skips
`@mdx-js/mdx` serialization and Babel parsing, if Babel is used anyway.

Babel does not support syntax extensions to its parser (it has “syntax” plugins
but those in fact turn certain flags on or off).
It does support setting a different parser.
Which in turn lets us choose whether to use the `@mdx-js/mdx` or
`@babel/parser`.

<details>
  <summary>Show plugin and sample use</summary>

  This plugin:

  ```js path="plugin.js"
  import path from 'node:path'
  import parser from '@babel/parser'
  import estreeToBabel from 'estree-to-babel'
  import {compileSync} from '@mdx-js/mdx'

  export function babelPluginSyntaxMdx() {
    // Tell Babel to use a different parser.
    return {parserOverride: babelParserWithMdx}
  }

  // A Babel parser that parses MDX files with `@mdx-js/mdx` and passes any
  // other things through to the normal Babel parser.
  function babelParserWithMdx(value, options) {
    if (
      options.sourceFilename &&
      /\.mdx?$/.test(path.extname(options.sourceFilename))
    ) {
      // Babel does not support async parsers, unfortunately.
      return compileSync(
        {value, path: options.sourceFilename},
        // Tell `@mdx-js/mdx` to return a Babel tree instead of serialized JS.
        {recmaPlugins: [recmaBabel], /* Other options… */}
      ).result
    }

    return parser.parse(value, options)
  }

  // A “recma” plugin is a unified plugin that runs on the estree (used by
  // `@mdx-js/mdx` and much of the JS ecosystem but not Babel).
  // This plugin defines `'estree-to-babel'` as the compiler, which means that
  // the resulting Babel tree is given back by `compileSync`.
  function recmaBabel() {
    Object.assign(this, {Compiler: estreeToBabel})
  }
  ```

  Can be used like so with the Babel API:

  ```js path="example.js"
  import babel from '@babel/core'
  import {babelPluginSyntaxMdx} from './plugin.js'

  // Note that a filename must be set for our plugin to know it’s MDX instead of JS.
  await babel.transformAsync(file, {filename: 'example.mdx', plugins: [babelPluginSyntaxMdx]})
  ```
</details>

### Site generators

#### Create React App (CRA)

[CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) supports webpack plugins
through webpack loader syntax in imports.
