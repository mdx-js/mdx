## What is this?

This package is a webpack loader to support MDX.

## When should I use this?

This integration is useful if you’re using webpack (or another tool that uses
webpack, such as Next.js or Rspack).

This integration can be combined with the Babel loader to compile modern
JavaScript features to ones your users support.

If you want to evaluate MDX code then the lower-level compiler (`@mdx-js/mdx`)
can be used manually.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 16+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/loader
```

## Use

Add something along these lines to your `webpack.config.js`:

```tsx
/** @type {import('webpack').Configuration} */
const webpackConfig = {
  module: {
    // …
    rules: [
      // …
      {
        test: /\.mdx?$/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
            /** @type {import('@mdx-js/loader').Options} */
            options: {/* jsxImportSource: …, otherOptions… */}
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

export default webpackConfig
```

See also [¶ Next.js][next] and [¶ Vue CLI][vue-cli], if you’re using webpack
through them, for more info.

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is [`mdx`][api-mdx].

### `mdx`

This package exports a [webpack][] plugin as the default export.
Configuration (see [`Options`][api-options]) are passed separately through
webpack.

### `Options`

Configuration (TypeScript type).

Options are the same as [`CompileOptions` from `@mdx-js/mdx`][compile-options]
with the exception that the `SourceMapGenerator` and `development` options are
supported based on how you configure webpack.
You cannot pass them manually.

## Examples

### Combine with Babel

If you use modern JavaScript features you might want to use Babel through
[`babel-loader`][babel-loader] to compile to code that works in older browsers:

```tsx
/** @type {import('webpack').Configuration} */
const webpackConfig = {
  module: {
    // …
    rules: [
      // …
      {
        test: /\.mdx?$/,
        use: [
          // Note that Webpack runs right-to-left: `@mdx-js/loader` is used first, then
          // `babel-loader`.
          {loader: 'babel-loader', options: {}},
          {
            loader: '@mdx-js/loader',
            /** @type {import('@mdx-js/loader').Options} */
            options: {}
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

export default webpackConfig
```

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
It exports the additional type [`Options`][api-options].
See [§ Types][types] on our website for information.

## Compatibility

Projects maintained by the unified collective are compatible with maintained
versions of Node.js.

When we cut a new major release, we drop support for unmaintained versions of
Node.
This means we try to keep the current release line, `@mdx-js/loader@^3`,
compatible with Node.js 16.
