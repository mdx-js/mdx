## What is this?

This package is a Node ESM loader to support MDX.
[ESM loaders][loader] are an experimental feature in Node, slated to change.
They let projects “hijack” imports to do all sorts of fancy things, in this
case it let’s you `import` MD(X) files.

## When should I use this?

This integration is useful if you’re using Node and want to import MDX files
from the file system.

If you’re using a bundler (webpack, Rollup, esbuild), or a site builder (Gatsby,
Next.js) or build system (Vite, WMR) which comes with a bundler, you’re better
off using another integration: see
[§ Integrations][integrations].

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/node-loader
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/node-loader
```

## Use

Say we have an MDX document, `example.mdx`:

```mdx
export const Thing = () => <>World!</>

# Hello, <Thing />
```

…and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import {renderToStaticMarkup} from 'react-dom/server'
import React from 'react'
import Content from './example.mdx'

console.log(renderToStaticMarkup(React.createElement(Content)))
```

…then running that with:

```sh
node --experimental-loader=@mdx-js/node-loader example.js
```

…yields:

```html
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```

## API

> 💡 **Experiment**: this is an experimental package that might not work

This package exports a Node [ESM loader][loader].
It also exports the following identifier: `createLoader`.

### `createLoader(options?)`

Create a Node ESM loader to compile MDX to JS.

##### `options`

`options` are the same as [`compile` from `@mdx-js/mdx`][options].
One extra field is supported:

###### `options.fixRuntimeWithoutExportMap`

Fix broken export maps (`boolean`, default: `true`).

Several JSX runtimes, notably React below 18 and Emotion below 11.10.0, don’t
have a proper export map set up.
Export maps are needed to map `xxx/jsx-runtime` to an actual file in ESM.
This option fixes React et al by turning those into `xxx/jsx-runtime.js`.

> 👉 **Note**: If you are using recent React, or other proper packages, you
> have to turn this field off.
> See the example below on how to configure your loader.
> Pass `fixRuntimeWithoutExportMap: false` in options to it.

###### Example

`my-loader.js`:

```js
import {createLoader} from '@mdx-js/node-loader'

// Load is for Node 17+, the rest for 12-16.
const {load, getFormat, transformSource} = createLoader(/* Options… */)

export {load, getFormat, transformSource}
```

This example can then be used with `node --experimental-loader=./my-loader.js`.

Node itself does not yet support multiple loaders but it is possible to combine
multiple loaders with [`@node-loader/core`][node-loader-core].

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
