A [React][] component that evaluates [MDX][].

> ⚠️ **warning**: this is not the preferred way to use MDX since it
> introduces a substantial amount of overhead and dramatically increases
> bundle sizes.
> It must not be used with user input that isn’t sandboxed.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/runtime
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/runtime
```

## Use

Say we have the following scripts, `example.jsx`:

### Props

The MDX Runtime component accepts two props:

| Name            | Description                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `components`    | Globally available components for the runtime                    |
| `scope`         | Variables that are accessible in the JSX portion of the document |
| `remarkPlugins` | Array of remark plugins                                          |

### Example code

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {renderToString} from 'react-dom/server'
import MDX from '@mdx-js/runtime'

// Custom components:
const components = {
  h1: props => <h1 style={{color: 'tomato'}} {...props} />,
  Demo: () => <p>This is a demo component</p>
}

// Data available in MDX:
const scope = {
  somethingInScope: 1
}

// The MDX:
const children = `
# Hello, world!

{1 + somethingInScope}

<Demo />

<div>Here is the scope variable: {some}</div>
`

const result = renderToString(
  <MDX components={components} scope={scope} children={children} />
)

console.log(result)
```

Now, building, bundling, and finally running it, yields:

```html
<h1 style="color:tomato">Hello, world!</h1>
2
<p>This is a demo component</p>
```
