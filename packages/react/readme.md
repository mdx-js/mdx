React renderer for [MDX][]: JSX in Markdown.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/react
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/react
```

## Use

Say we have the following code in `example.mdx`:

```markdown
# Hello, world! {1 + 1}
```

And our script, `example.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import {renderToString} from 'react-dom/server'

import Example from './example.mdx'

const h1 = props => <h1 style={{color: 'tomato'}} {...props} />

console.log(
  renderToString(
    <MDXProvider components={{h1}}>
      <Example />
    </MDXProvider>
  )
)
```

Now, building, bundling, and finally running it, yields:

```html
<h1 style="color:tomato">Hello, world! 2</h1>
```

Note that you must configure whatever you use to load `.mdx` files to use `mdx`
from `@mdx-js/react`.
The webpack loader does this automatically.
