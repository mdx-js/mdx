## What is this?

This package is a context based components provider for combining React with
MDX.

## When should I use this?

This package is not needed for MDX to work with React.
See [Â¶ MDX provider in Â§ Using MDX][use-provider] for when and how to use an MDX
provider.

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm]:
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/react
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/react
```

## Use

```js
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import Post from './post.mdx'
// ^-- Assumes an integration is used to compile MDX to JS, such as
// `@mdx-js/esbuild`, `@mdx-js/loader`, `@mdx-js/node-loader`, or
// `@mdx-js/rollup`, and that it is configured with
// `options.providerImportSource: '@mdx-js/react'`.

const components = {
  em: props => <i {...props} />
}

<MDXProvider components={components}>
  <Post />
</MDXProvider>
```

Note that you donâ€™t have to use `MDXProvider` and can pass components
directly:

```diff
-<MDXProvider components={components}>
-  <Post />
-</MDXProvider>
+<Post components={components} />
```

See [Â¶ React in Â§ Getting started][start-react] for how to get started with MDX
and React.
See [Â¶ MDX provider in Â§ Using MDX][use-provider] for how to use an MDX
provider.

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `MDXContext`, `MDXProvider`,
`useMDXComponents`, and `withMDXComponents`.
There is no default export.

### `MDXProvider(props?)`

Provider for MDX context.

##### `props`

Configuration (`Object`, optional).

###### `props.components`

Mapping of names for JSX components to React components
(`Record<string, string|Component|Components>`, optional).

###### `props.disableParentContext`

Turn off outer component context (`boolean`, default: `false`).

###### `props.children`

Children (JSX elements, optional).

##### Returns

JSX element.

### `useMDXComponents(components?)`

Get current components from the MDX Context.

###### `components`

Additional components (`Components`) to use or a function that takes the current
components and filters/merges/changes them (`(currentComponents: Components) =>
Components`).

###### Returns

`Components`.

### `MDXContext`

> ðŸª¦ **Deprecated**: This export is not recommended for use as it exposes
> internals which should be hidden.
> It might be removed in a future major release.
> Please use `useMDXComponents` to get context based components and
> `MDXProvider` to set context based components instead.

The React Context for MDX (`React.Context`).

### `withMDXComponents(Component)`

> ðŸª¦ **Deprecated**: This export is not recommended for use.
> It might be removed in a future major release.
> Please use `useMDXComponents` to get context based components instead.

Create a HOC of `Components` which is given the current context based MDX
components.

## Types
