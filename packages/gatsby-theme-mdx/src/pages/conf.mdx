## About

Join us for the first MDX conference!
We’ll stream it directly to you, for free.

MDX has grown rapidly since the [first commit][] two and a half years ago.
We’d like to celebrate our accomplishments so far, and talk about what lies
ahead. We’ve got lots of plans.

Learn how MDX increases developer productivity, improves educational
content authoring, and even peek behind the curtains to see how MDX works.
