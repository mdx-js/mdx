Vue renderer for [MDX][]: JSX in Markdown.

## Install

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/vue
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/vue
```

## Use

Say we have the following code in `example.mdx`:

```markdown
# Hello, world! {1 + 1}
```

And our script, `example.jsx`:

```jsx
import Vue from 'vue'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/vue'
import Example from './example.mdx'

const components = {
  h1: {
    render(h) {
      return h('h1', {style: {color: 'tomato'}}, this.$slots.default)
    }
  }
}

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render(h) {
    return h(MDXProvider, {props: {components}}, Example)
  }
}).$mount()
```

Now, building, bundling, and finally running it, yields:

```html
<div>
  <h1 style="color: tomato;">Hello, world! 2</h1>
</div>
```

Note that you must configure whatever you use to load `.mdx` files to work with
Vue.
That can be done with `@mdx-js/vue-loader` in webpack.
