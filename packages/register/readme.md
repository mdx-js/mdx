## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install @mdx-js/register
```

[yarn][]:

```sh
yarn add @mdx-js/register
```

## What is this?

This package is a Node CommonJS hook to support MDX.
It let’s you `require` MD(X) files.

## When should I use this?

This integration is useful if you’re using Node, for some reason have to use
CJS, and want to require MDX files from the file system.

This package is not ideal as it uses a deprecated Node API.

At this point in time, you’re better off with `@mdx-js/node-loader`, even though
it uses an experimental Node API.
